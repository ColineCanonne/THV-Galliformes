Adaptive management informs conservation and monitoring of Australias threatened malleefowl Monitoring is an essential component of adaptive management and a carefully designed program is needed to ensure high-quality data and inferences over realistic time scales Co-operation among agencies and incorporating citizen science may help enhance learning while reducing the financial costs of monitoring We seek to realise this potential while conserving the Australian malleefowl Leipoa ocellata An established network of citizen scientists provide low-cost sustainable annual monitoring data yet the most effective actions for conserving malleefowl remain highly uncertain The continent-wide species distribution presents significant challenges including multiple environmental strata to sample and numerous management jurisdictions We outline an adaptive management framework that aims to unify malleefowl conservation priorities nationally and target monitoring efforts We elicited a model structure for the drivers of and threats to malleefowl persistence in a workshop with land managers and advocates We parameterised 80 uncertain interactions within this structure using novel ensemble modelling techniques and identified the effectiveness of predator control as a critical uncertainty affecting malleefowl persistence We developed a classical spatially replicated experimental design to test whether malleefowl breed more frequently where predators are suppressed The proposed monitoring design will rely on the contributions of several dozen land managers and 200-300 citizen scientists annually We have developed a broad stakeholder base a proactive communication strategy and an agile approach to accessing resources to foster resilience and longevity in the monitoring program If malleefowl conservation successfully adapts in response to monitoring outcomes it will become one of the largest adaptive management programs on the planet Citizen science Leipoa ocellata Feral predator Structured decision making Stakeholder engagement Ensemble modelling Statistical power
