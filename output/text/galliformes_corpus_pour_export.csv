Co-operation among agencies and incorporating citizen science may help enhance learning while reducing the financial costs of monitoring. We seek to realise this potential while conserving the Australian malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata). An established network of citizen scientists provide low-cost, sustainable annual monitoring data, yet the most effective actions for conserving malleefowl remain highly uncertain. The continent-wide species' distribution presents significant challenges, including multiple environmental strata to sample and numerous management jurisdictions. We outline an adaptive management framework that aims to unify malleefowl conservation priorities nationally, and target monitoring efforts. We elicited a model structure for the drivers of, and threats to, malleefowl persistence in a workshop with land managers and advocates. We parameterised 80 uncertain interactions within this structure using novel ensemble modelling techniques and identified the effectiveness of predator control as a critical uncertainty affecting malleefowl persistence. We developed a classical, spatially replicated experimental design to test whether malleefowl breed more frequently where predators are suppressed. The proposed monitoring design will rely on the contributions of several dozen land managers and 200-300 citizen scientists annually. We have developed a broad stakeholder base, a proactive communication strategy, and an agile approach to accessing resources to foster resilience and longevity in the monitoring program. If malleefowl conservation successfully adapts in response to monitoring outcomes, it will become one of the largest adaptive management programs on the planet.";"Citizen science; Leipoa ocellata; Feral predator; Structured decision making; Stakeholder engagement; Ensemble modelling; Statistical power";2019;"BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION";"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

However, the precise relationships between landscape changes, spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and habitat preferences in response to those changes remain poorly known. We investigated patterns of habitat selection and causes for changes over the years 1997-2017 for the gray partridge Perdix perdix, an iconic farmland species which has experienced a severe decline since the 1950s. Using a long-term (1997-2017) dataset collected over 435 km(2), we modeled relationships between annual land-cover maps and partridge sightings over 17 5-year moving windows, assessing the effects of landscape metrics, the strength of the relationships, and the dynamics of habitat suitability. We detected a shift in gray partridge habitat preferences over time, toward more risky habitats. Avoidance of predator reservoirs (woodlands and buildings) has weakened, and selection of human infrastructure, such as roads and tracks, has increased. Since 1997, the mean size of suitable patches has also decreased by about 26%. We have interpreted these changes in habitat selection as being the result of decreasing habitat quality and the increasing prevalence of captive-reared birds, currently released in their thousands in the study site. Synthesis and applications. The gray partridge has not adjusted well to changes in farming practices, and the low, still decreasing, population density suggests that it is not sustainable, despite local initiatives and the investment in captive-bird releases. We emphasize that efforts must be redirected toward habitat improvement to restore the density of refuge cover, insects, and seeds in the landscape, hunting management to ensure self-sustainable populations and massive releases of high-quality birds. Only integrated local management, involving hunters, farmers, gamekeepers, and scientists can ensure the recovery of this species.";"agricultural landscapes; farmland birds; gray partridge; habitat quality; habitat selection; habitat suitability maps; long-term trends; Perdix perdix";2019;"ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION";"Ecology; Evolutionary Biology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

In passerines, aggression during nest-site defence is one of those behaviours that have been steadily found to be repeatable within individuals. Furthermore, in several cases, aggression was related to some estimates of reproductive investment. Here, we studied the possibility that behaviour of males toward a male rival predicts the amount of their future parental care. This could be beneficial to the females, because during mate choice, they could use male aggressive behaviour as a cue for parental quality. We performed the study by video recording the nestling feeding activity of male collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) that were assayed for aggression during the courtship period. The level of aggression was not related to feeding rate in males. Feeding rate of males differed between the study years, but it did not correlate with the feeding rate of their mates, neither was it related to the morphological traits of the parents. We may conclude that nest-site defence aggression of males does not predict their parental commitment. This may be surprising given that higher testosterone levels that may be expected in aggressive males often suppress parental care. However, among-individual variance in male testosterone profiles found to be decrease from the courtship to the parenting period in flycatchers, and this may explain why differences in territorial aggression did not manifest in differences in nestling provisioning. The correlation between behaviours that are expressed in distinct periods of the annual cycle of songbirds needs further investigation.Significance statementMale songbirds, when attracting mates, are often confronted with each other over nest-sites, and these male-male confrontations may be witnessed by females. If performance during territory defence predicts the quality of parental care that a male will provide for its nestlings, females could use defence behaviour as a cue for mate choice. To explore this possibility, we investigated the relationship between territorial aggression and nestling feeding activity of male collared flycatchers. We performed simulated territorial intrusions to measure the aggression of males and recorded their nestling feeding rate about a month later. We found that territorial aggression did not correlate with nestling feeding rate. This suggests that nest-site defence behaviour in the beginning of the breeding season does not carry information for females about what to expect from potential mates in terms of parental care.";"Animal personality; Behavioural syndrome; Nestling feeding; Male-male competition; Mate choice; Parental care";2019;"BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY";"Behavioral Sciences; Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Yet in human modified landscapes, habitat selection might not always lead to increased fitness because animals undervalue high-quality resources that appear less attractive than those of lower quality. In the American West, agriculture has modified landscapes, yet little is known about whether agricultural changes alter the reliability of the cues animals use to identify habitat quality; ultimately forming maladaptive breeding strategies where behavioral cues are mismatched with survival outcomes. Using the greater sage-grouse, a species highly dependent upon sagebrush landscapes, we (1) evaluated how females select nesting habitats based on sagebrush type, along with livestock grazing related linear and point features, and other biotic, abiotic characteristics, given hypothesized influences on hiding cover, microclimate and predator travel routes and perches, (2) compared habitat selection information with results for nest survival estimates to evaluate if selection appears to be adaptive or not, and (3) used our results to evaluate the most appropriate strategies for this species in a grazing-modified landscape. Nest-site selection for sagebrush type appears to be maladaptive: in the most-preferred sagebrush type, nest survival rate was one-fourth the rate realized by females nesting in the sagebrush type avoided. Nest survival was four times higher for nests placed away from (> 100 m), rather than next to (1 m), the nearest fence, and survival was lower within sites with higher cow pie density (a proxy for previous grazing intensity). Live and dead grasses influenced selection and survival in opposing ways such that dead grass was selected for but resulted in reduced survival while live grass was avoided but resulted in increased survival. Results collectively provide the first empirical evidence that a specific type of sagebrush acts as an ecological trap while another sagebrush type is undervalued. These results also suggest that adding more fences to control livestock grazing systems will likely reduce sage-grouse nest survival.";"Maladaptive selection; Grazing; Fences; Sagebrush; Sage-grouse";2019;"JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT";"Environmental Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Hormone synthesis is sensitive to environmental factors, and maternal hormones are thus a powerful mechanism to transfer environmental cues to the next generation. Birds have become a key model for the study of hormone-mediated maternal effects because the embryo develops outside the mother's body, facilitating the measurement and manipulation of prenatal hormone exposure. At the same time, birds are excellent models for the integration of both proximate and ultimate approaches, which is key to a better understanding of the evolution of hormone-mediated maternal effects. Over the past two decades, a surge of studies on hormone-mediated maternal effects has revealed an increasing number of discrepancies. In this review, we discuss the role of the environment, genetic factors and social interactions in causing these discrepancies and provide a framework to resolve them. We also explore the largely neglected role of the embryo in modulating the maternal signal, as well as costs and benefits of hormone transfer and expression for the different family members. We conclude by highlighting fruitful avenues for future research that have opened up thanks to new theoretical insights and technical advances in the field.

While strategic sperm allocation has been studied extensively, little is known about concomitant changes in seminal fluid (SF) and its molecular composition, despite increasing evidence that SF proteins (SFPs) are fundamental in fertility and sperm competition. Here, we show that in male red junglefowl, Gallus gallus, along with changes in sperm numbers and SF investment, SF composition changed dynamically over successive matings with a first female, immediately followed by mating with a second, sexually novel female. The SF proteome exhibited a pattern of both protein depletion and enrichment over successive matings, including progressive increases in immunity and plasma proteins. Ejaculates allocated to the second female had distinct proteomic profiles, where depletion of many SFPs was compensated by increased investment in others. This response was partly modulated by male social status: when mating with the second, novel female, subdominants (but not dominants) preferentially invested in SFPs associated with sperm composition, which may reflect status-specific differences in mating rates, sperm maturation and sperm competition. Global proteomic SF analysis thus reveals that successive matings trigger rapid, dynamic SFP changes driven by a combination of depletion and strategic allocation.";NA;2019;"SCIENTIFIC REPORTS";"Multidisciplinary Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Correspondingly, the majority (76%) of seabird species in temperate and polar regions breed in spring/summer, matching the peak in ocean productivity. The Fiordland penguin Eudyptes pachyrhynchus is one of only 34 seabird species worldwide that have part of their breeding cycle during the winter, and its chicks fledge when the eggs of congeneric Eudyptes species in the same region are only starting to hatch. Little is known of the foraging ecology of this species and the factors that may influence its timing of breeding. In the present study, the foraging behaviour of breeding individuals from Taumaka/Open Bay Island, New Zealand, was investigated using GPS, dive recorder and tri-axis accelerometer data loggers. In total, 35 individuals (4 males, 31 females) were tracked at sea, revealing extensive use of continental shelf slope (200-1000 m) habitat within 42 +/- 5 km of the colony. Individuals foraged mostly during daylight in the epi-pelagic zone (mean modal depth 22 +/- 2 m) and prey encounter events occurred in 50% of dives. Blood isotopic signatures suggest a trophic level indicative of squid consumption, supporting previous findings that winter-spawning squid are the most important prey type. The results of the present study suggest that a winter-breeding strategy by seabirds can reflect locally abundant prey resources and suitable conditions at the time for breeding.";"Foraging behaviour; Winter breeding; Bio-logging; Prey encounter; Eudyptes pachyrhynchus; New Zealand";2019;"MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES";"Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

As an intact input-pacemaker-output system, each of these structures is linked within a neuroendocrine loop to influence downstream processes and peripheral oscillations. While our previous study found that monochromatic light affected the circadian rhythms of clock genes in the chick retina, the effect of the pineal gland on the response of the retinal circadian clock under monochromatic light still remains unclear. In this study, a total of 144 chicks, including sham-operated and pinealectomized groups, were exposed to white, red, green or blue light. After 2 weeks of light illumination, the circadian expression of six core clock genes (cClock, cBmal1, cCry1, cCry2, cPer2 and cPer3), melanopsin (cOpn4-1, cOpn4-2), Arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (cAanat) and melatonin was examined in the retina. The cBmal1, cCry1, cPer2, cPer3, cOpn4-1, cOpn4-2 and cAanat genes as well as melatonin had circadian rhythmic expression in both the sham-operated and pinealectomized groups under different monochromatic lights, while cClock and cCry2 had arrhythmic 24 h profiles in all of the light-treated groups. After pinealectomy, the rhythmicity of the clock genes, melanopsins, cAanat and melatonin in the chick retina did not change, especially the mesors, amplitudes and phases of cBmal1, cOpn4-1, cOpn4-2, cAanat and melatonin. Compared to the white light group, however, green light increased the mRNA expression of the positive-regulating clock genes cBmal1, cAanat, cOpn4-1 and cOpn4-2 as well as the melatonin content in pinealectomized chicks, whereas red light decreased their expression. These results suggest that the chick retina is a relatively independent circadian oscillator from the pineal gland, whose circadian rhythmicity (including photoreception, molecular clock and melatonin output) is not altered after pinealectomization. Moreover, green light increases ocular cAanat expression and melatonin synthesis by accelerating the expression of melanopsin and positive-regulating clock genes cBmal1 and cClock.";"Pinealectomy; circadian clock gene; melatonin; monochromatic light; retina; chick";2019;"CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL";"Biology; Physiology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

However, the predator dilution effect hypothesis predicts a decrease in the per capita chance of being depredated with an increasing amount of prey. We evaluated these hypotheses through an artificial nest survival study. We estimated nest survival during both the non-breeding and breeding seasons of 2014 at a restinga (sand-coastal-plain) area in southeastern Brazil. We installed 450 artificial nests (cup shaped) in each season and placed a Common quail (Coturnix coturnix) egg in each nest, totaling 900 nests. During the non-breeding season, our nests were the only ones present and thus the predator dilution effect should be absent. We estimated daily survival rate (DSR) using the ""Nest Survival"" function in the program MARK. We found a decrease in DSR at the middle and end in comparison with the onset of the non-breeding season, which supports the predator search image hypothesis. In comparison with the non-breeding season, we also found that DSR of artificial nests was lower at the onset and end of the breeding season, but higher in the middle of the breeding season. This pattern matched the higher availability of prey (i.e. natural nests) in the middle of the breeding season in the study site, supporting the dilution effect hypothesis. The survival rate of artificial nests suggests that both the search image and the dilution effect may occur during the breeding season, and that the predator dilution effect masks the predator search image in the middle of the breeding season. Our results expand our understanding regarding the effects of the search image and predator dilution effect hypotheses on nest predation, showing that both are density-dependent and may occur during the breeding season.";"artificial nests; breeding success; density-dependent predation; Neotropical; restinga";2019;"AUK";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We investigated the impacts of oil and gas development on space use of bobwhite using a multiseason approach. We captured and monitored bob-white in the breeding season (1 April-30 September, n = 135 individuals) and nonbreeding season (1 October-31 March, n = 30 coveys) andmodeled their habitat selection in a resource-utilization function (third order, within home range selection) and resource-selection function (second order, home range selection) format. Generally, energy infrastructure effects on bobwhite were neutral, but breeding season bobwhite did select for areas near low-traffic roads (beta= -0.31 +/- 0.15 SE). In the nonbreeding season, coveys selected for areas within their homerangewith a limited viewshed (i.e., areas with limited visibility of anthropogenic structures; beta= -0.03 +/- 0.02 SE). Selection differed between sexes for well pads (t = -2.12, P= 0.04) but was otherwise similar. At the level of home range selection, bobwhite exhibited a preference for areas with a low density of oil and gas wells and a high density of low-traffic roads during both the breeding and nonbreeding seasons (breeding: beta(well) = -0.14 +/- 0.02, beta(road) = 0.26 +/- 0.27; nonbreeding: beta(well) = -0.08 +/- 0.03, beta(road) = 0.16 +/- 0.03). As a generalist species, bobwhite appear to be largely tolerant of energy infrastructure and associated disturbances at moderate levels of development but may be sensitive to high densities of oil and gas pads.

Variable soil water, precocious germination and emergence, and the presence of soil fungal pathogens often reduce plant establishment. Novel restoration treatments that increase soil water during early forb life stages, delay germination and emergence to coincide with favorable spring conditions, and reduce mortality from soil fungal pathogens may benefit native forb restoration. We compared the efficacy of three novel treatments-snow fencing, plant protection fabric, and seed coatings-to improve establishment of a forb species native to the Great Basin, basalt milkvetch (Astragalus filipes Torr. ex A. Gray). We replicated treatments plus a notreatment control at three sites in the Great Basin in a randomized complete block design over 2 yr. To evaluate the efficacy of our restoration treatments, we measured germination, seedling emergence, establishment, and second-yr survival. The effects of snow fencing and plant protection fabric varied by site and life stage and were likely influenced by thewet spring conditions across sites, particularly the two northern sites. Snow fencing increased establishment and second-yr survival at one site. Plant protection fabric did not benefit any life stage at any site. Seed coatings increased seedling emergence at all sites but did not affect establishment or survival. Overall, second-yr survival remained low across all sites and treatments. Our study indicates that our treatments can positively affect basalt milkvetchemergence, establishment, and survival, but additional management actions are needed to improve long-term restoration success of native forbs.

Although individual plant ages can frequently be determined in this manner, the method is time consuming and of limited value for plants that have lost stem wood from stem splitting and rot. Nondestructive methods for estimating big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) plant age would be useful in assessing stand age structure and population dynamics at variable spatial scales. The purpose of this study was to test a suite of traits for potential use in estimating mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana [Rydb.] Beetle) age. We evaluated traits including plant height, crown area, subcanopy litter depth, percent crown mortality, bark furrow depth, bark fiber length, circumference and diameter of plant basal stem, and circumference of secondary and tertiary branches. We measured and harvested basal cross-sections from 163 plants of varying sizes from five locations in central and south-central Utah. Plant age was determined from annual growth rings. Linear regression analyses revealed that stem diameter (r(2) = 0.507 P < 0.0001) was the most highly correlated variable with plant age across all sites, followed by stem circumference (r(2) = 0.474 P < 0.0001), secondary branch circumference (r(2) = 0.360, P < 0.0001), tertiary branch circumference (r(2) = 0.405, P < 0.0001), and bark fiber length (r(2) = 0.373, P < 0.0001). Results support previous findings that stem girth has value for estimating mountain big sagebrush plant age and that this trait is a better indicator of age than any other tested traits. Although the relationship between stem diameter and plant age was significant, substantial stem size variability associated with plants of the same approximate age indicates that the method is most appropriate when precise age estimates are not required. This technique was developed specifically for mountain big sagebrush, but it is expected that it can be adapted for other sagebrush taxa. (C) 2019 The Society for Range Management.

Francolin F. francolinus belongs to the poultry family, and like other members of the family, it is hunted by humans because of the beauty and tender meat, although it is a protected bird. Jazinak corridor, with an area of about 130,000 hectares, is located in the southeastern part of Zabola city in the north of Sistan and Baluchestan province. The drought crises of Sistan in recent years have transformed the environmental conditions by changing the ecological indicators, and lack of food has reduced the bird's desire to mate. The aim of this study was to examine the threatening and destructing factors associated with the habitat of francolin in Sistan region-Jazinak corridor. The research method was analytically and descriptively aided by field observations, and it was conducted using satellite images, questionnaires, and climatic parameters. The obtained results show that the drought has made a devastating strike on the population of this bird by destroying the farming, agriculture, and shrub lands which where used to be the actual environment, refuge, and the place of reproduction for it. In fact, the biggest impact of drought on francolin's population is the destruction of its habitat. Hence, the remaining population of the francolin species requires a strong support.";"Francolin F; francolinus; Ecological indicators; Satellite images; Drought";2019;"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY";"Environmental Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Despite the importance of male lek attendance (i.e., proportion of males on leks available for detection) influencing lek counts, patterns of within season and between season variability in attendance rates are not well understood. We used high-frequency global positioning system (GPS) telemetry data from male greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; n=67) over five lekking seasons (2013-2017) at eight study sites in Nevada to estimate lek attendance rates. Specifically, we recorded daily locations of sage-grouse in relation to mapped lek boundaries and used generalized additive models to assess temporal variation in attendance rates by age class (subadult vs. adult). Average timing of peak attendance occurred on 16 April but varied from March 16, 2014 to April 21 , 2016. Overall, adult males attended leks at higher rates (0.683 at peak) and earlier in the season (19 March) than subadults (0.421 at peak on April 19). Peak attendance probability was positively related to cumulative winter precipitation. Daily probabilities of lek switching differed between adults (0.019 at peak on March 3) and subadults (0.046 at peak on March 22), and lek switching was negatively related to distance to nearest lek. Our results indicate variable patterns in lek attendance through time, and that lek switching may occur at higher rates than previously thought. We demonstrate the use of generalizable daily attendance curves to date-correct lek counts and derive estimates of male abundance, although such an approach will likely require the incorporation of information on age structure to produce robust results that are useful for population monitoring.";"Centrocercus urophasianus; greater sage-grouse; lek attendance; lek count; lek switching; Nevada";2019;"POPULATION ECOLOGY";"Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The aims of the present study were to evaluate the effect of male to female sex ratio on hatching rate and fertility and to determine the optimal temperature and time for egg storage and its effect on hatching rate and embryonic mortality in Chukar partridges. Maximum hatching rate and fertility rate were affected by male:female ratios during breeding (P < 0.05). The greatest embryonic mortality rate was with eggs that were stored at 25 degrees C for 15-20 d, however, the greatest hatching rate was when eggs were stored at 10 and 15 degrees C for 5 days. Storage time of Chukar partridge eggs can be extended for as long as 5 d, but longer storage periods can negatively affect hatching rate.

However, there has been a population decline in this area over recent decades. Consistent reports indicate a high prevalence of the eyeworm (Oxyspirura petrowi) and caecal worm (Aulonocephalus pennula), which may be of major influence on the bobwhite population. While research has suggested pathological consequences and genetic relatedness to other pathologically significant parasites, little is known about the influence of climate on these parasites. In this study, we examined whether seasonal temperature and precipitation influences the intensity of these parasites in bobwhite. We also analyzed quantitative PCR results for bobwhite feces and cloacal swabs against temperature and precipitation to identify climatic impacts on parasite reproduction in this region. Multiple linear regression analyses were used for parasite intensity investigation while binary logistic regression analyses were used for parasite reproduction studies. Our analyses suggest that caecal worm intensity, caecal worm reproduction, and eyeworm reproduction are influenced by temperature and precipitation. Temperature data was collected 15, 30, and 60 days prior to the date of collection of individual bobwhite and compared to qPCR results to generate a temperature range that may influence future eyeworm reproduction.

Control of mid-sized mammalian nest predators (i.e., meso-mammals) is often conducted to increase reproductive success on lands managed for bobwhites. Nest predation by meso-mammals, however, is only one part of a complex predator-prey trophic system. There is limited understanding of the effect of nest predators on bobwhite demographics, which creates uncertainty about the efficacy of nest predator control. We quantified demographic effects on bobwhite populations from reducing meso-mammals on 4 study areas managed for bobwhites in northern Florida and southwestern Georgia, USA, during 2000-2006. After 1 year of pre-treatment monitoring (2000), we reduced meso-mammal nest predator abundance through trapping over 3-year intervals, March to September, on 2 sites using a crossover design. Efficacy of trapping was demonstrated by a 43% reduction in scent station visitation rates of meso-mammals. Meso-mammal control increased all demographic metrics including a 30% increase in nesting propensity, a 10% increase in nest success, and a 43% increase in chicks produced. Despite significant regional variation in breeding season survival rates, this equated to an average 18% increase in autumn density on trapped sites. Decision-makers should weigh the tradeoffs between bobwhite population goals and costs of meso-mammal control, where those that value maximum bobwhite density and reduced annual variation should likely implement control of meso-mammals.

However, it is rarely studied in birds, with most previous work concentrating on differential settlement by the sexes in discrete habitats, often separated by large distances. Little attention has been paid to patterns of segregation within the same site. We reared 200 Common Pheasants Phasianus colchicus and released them onto a relatively small site of 250 ha and recorded their patterns of association and differential use of artificial feeders in space and time. Particular feeders were preferred by one sex, although we found no features of the local habitat which explained such preferences. Furthermore, we found sex differences in the use of feeders throughout the day, with females preferentially visiting them in the morning and the proportion of females visiting feeders increasing as the year progressed. Social network analyses found that in the first month after release into the wild, females did not associate strongly with other females, which was surprising as, prior to release, females have been shown to associate with other females in both semi-natural conditions and when tested in isolation. However, sexual segregation was clearly seen after 1 month of being released and became more pronounced as the year progressed. Females associated with other females from November to February, whereas males avoided other males over this same period. Sexes became less likely to associate with one another in 5 of the 6 months monitored. Such avoidance observed in males suggests that they start to form territories much sooner than previously thought. Pheasants exhibit clear patterns of fine-scale sexual segregation based on space and time, which was observed in their social preferences at feeding sites. Such detailed fine-scale segregation is rarely observed in birds.";"feeder use; habitat; spatial segregation; temporal segregation";2019;"IBIS";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

In a peri-urban agricultural landscape in eastern Japan that lacks large ungulates but supports small generalist herbivores, fewer native seedlings have become established in thickets dominated by native dwarf bamboo, Pleioblastus chino (Franch. et Sav.) Makino. The mechanisms limiting tree seedling establishment are unknown. Our aim here was to evaluate the influence of interactions among the dwarf bamboo, its litter cover and small vertebrate herbivores on the microsite conditions governing the establishment of native tree seedlings from different successional stages in an old field in temperate Japan. Methods First, seedling emergence and survival of seeded Pinus densiflora Siebold et Zucc., Celtis sinensis Pers., Aphananthe aspera (Thunb.) Planch., Quercus serrata Murray, Quercus myrsinifolia Blume and Castanopsis sieboldii (Makino) Hatus. ex T. Yamaz. et Mashiba were observed in a factorial design that accounted for the presence or absence of dwarf bamboo and its litter cover, as well as the exclusion or access of small vertebrate fauna, in 2009 and 2010. To identify small vertebrate herbivores that reduced the emergence or survival of tree seedlings in the first experiment, reseeding experiments using P. densiflora, C. sinensis, A. aspera and Q. myrsinifolia were conducted by video trapping in 2011 and video and still-camera trapping in 2012. Important Findings The abiotic conditions under the dwarf bamboo were lethal to early- to mid-successional P. densiflora, C. sinensis, A. aspera and Q. serrata but led to better survivalalthough spindly growthof late-successional Q. myrsinifolia and C. sieboldii. The main consumers and the plants they found palatable differed between the bamboo thickets and the intervening gaps. Predation by mice appeared to have severely limited the emergence of all species, particularly in the bamboo thickets but occasionally in the gaps, whereas litter cover slightly mitigated this limitation. However, bamboo litter cover reduced the emergence of P. densiflora in the gaps. Chinese bamboo partridge (Bambusicola thoracicus Temminck), an introduced game bird, selectively and severely fed on the cotyledonsand probably seedsof A. aspera and moderately preyed upon those of P. densiflora in the gaps. Apparent consumption of seedlings in the gaps by the Japanese hare (Lepus brachyurus Temminck) suppressed the growth of all species but apparently did not severely affect emergence and survival. Thus, the net balance of positive and negative interactions at the bamboo thicket scale (i.e. the presence of dominant dwarf bamboo cover or intervening gaps and the herbivore behaviours in these two environments) and at the microsite level (i.e. litter cover) shapes the early establishment patterns of native tree seedlings, and this balance differs among tree seedling species.";"bamboo cover; farmland abandonment; microsite limitation; selective herbivory; Pleioblastus chino";2019;"JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY";"Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Thereby, it is expected to have consequences for fitness. Here, we explored the relationship between aggression and fitness in a long-term database collected in a wild population of the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis). We quantified the aggression of males during nest-site defence by conducting simulated territorial intrusions in the courtship period. We estimated the fitness of males based on their pairing success, breeding output and survival to next year. Earlier arriving and older males had a higher probability to establish pair-bond, and males that started to breed earlier fledged more young. Aggression did not predict pairing and breeding performances. However, the probability of a male to return in the next year was significantly related to aggression in an age-dependent manner. Among subadult males, more aggressive individuals had higher chances to return, while among adult males, less aggressive ones did so. This finding is in harmony with our general observation that subadult collared flycatcher males behave more aggressively than adult males when confronted with a conspecific intruder. Subadult males may be socially inexperienced, so they should be more aggressive to be successful. In contrast, if adult males suffer from higher physiological costs, a lower level of aggression may be more advantageous for them. Our study shows that aggressive behaviour can be a fitness-related trait, and to understand its role in determining fitness, age should be taken into account.";"Life-history; Male-male contest; Passerine; Personality; Territorial competition";2019;"SCIENCE OF NATURE";"Multidisciplinary Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Similarly, at the landscape scale, satellite fixes from the last week of life were distributed disproportionately on grouse moors in comparison to the overall use of such areas.

They are vocal animals and one can expect that birds threatened by their predation, such as black grouse, are sensitive to and recognize their calls. Within the framework of field studies, we noticed that adult black grouse were alerted by raven calls during periods outside the breeding season. Since black grouse are large, extremely precocial birds, this reaction can hardly be explained by sensitization specifically to the threat of nest predation by ravens. This surprising observation prompted us to study the phenomenon more systematically. According to our knowledge, the response of birds to corvid vocalization has been studied in altricial birds only. We tested whether the black grouse distinguishes and responds specifically to playback calls of the common raven. Black grouse recognized raven calls and were alerted, displaying typical neck stretching, followed by head scanning, and eventual escape. Surprisingly, males tended to react faster and exhibited a longer duration of vigilance behavior compared to females. Although raven calls are recognized by adult black grouse out of the nesting period, they are not directly endangered by the raven. We speculate that the responsiveness of adult grouse to raven calls might be explained as a learned response in juveniles from nesting hens that is then preserved in adults, or by a known association between the raven and the red fox. In that case, calls of the raven would be rather interpreted as a warning signal of probable proximity of the red fox.";"Tetrao; Warning call; Corvids; Vocal recognition; Nest predator; Playback; Acoustic; Predation";2019;"PEERJ";"Multidisciplinary Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Here we questioned whether, more than mere visual presence, human behaviour affects laying hen behaviour and subsequently their offspring's behaviour. We hypothesized that human behaviour triggers maternal effects via variations in yolk hormone levels. For five consecutive weeks, two groups of hens were exposed to the same durations of human presence (30 min twice a day, five days a week) but the behaviour of the human differed between groups. The first group (H +) was exposed to predictable arrival of the experimenter, slow movements combined with static presence, stroking daring handling and human voice. Whereas the second group of hens (H-) was exposed to unpredictable arrival of the experimenter which remained silent, in motion, and did not provide stroking during handling. At the end of the treatment, we evaluated egg quality and offspring behaviour. We found that avoidance of the experimenter by H+ hens but not by H- hens decreased significantly. Fertility rates and concentrations of yolk progesterone and estradiol in H + hens' eggs were higher than in H- hens' eggs. Fear of humans, neophobia or the capacity to solve a detour task did not differ significantly between H+ and Hchicks. Social discrimination tests showed that H+ chicks but not Fl- chicks typically preferred a familiar conspecific to a stranger. These results show that, with the same duration in the presence of the birds, humans through their behaviour engender variations in fertility rates, yolk hormone levels and transgenerational effects on social skills. Rarely explored, our data suggest that maternal effects influence filial imprinting. These data have broad implications for laboratory, commercial systems and conservatory programs where the inevitable presence of humans could trigger maternal effects on offspring phenotype.";"Maternal effects; Yolk hormones; Behaviour; Filial imprinting";2019;"PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR";"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Carcasses were removed or consumed within 2.7 +/- 1.8 d, and vertebrates removed the carcass in 74% of trials. Carcasses persisted for similar lengths of time between the 2 vegetation types, but avian scavengers were significantly more common on Bobwhite Quail carcasses in grassland, and mammalian scavengers were significantly more common on House Mouse carcasses in shrubland habitats.

Many predators feed primarily on rodents when the densities of rodents are high and change to alternative prey (eggs or young birds) when the main prey populations decrease. Aims During a 3-year study, predation on an artificial nest was related to population dynamics of small mammals in coniferous and deciduous forests in the Tatra Mountains (western Carpathians). Methods Small mammals were captured using the live traps. In deciduous forest habitats, we placed 36 traps and, in coniferous forest habitats, we placed 18 traps. In total, 174 artificial nests imitating broods of hazel grouse (Tetrastes bonansia) were located randomly in both types of forest habitat between 2012 and 2014. Predators of the artificial nests were identified by camera-traps at 87 nests. Key results Most of the artificial nests were lost to predation by mammals. The most numerous species of rodents in both types of forest habitat were the yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis) and the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). A significant decrease in the number of rodents was followed by a considerable increase of predation on artificial nests. There were no significant differences in the rates of predation between the two forest-habitat types. Conclusions Our results support the alternative prey hypothesis and suggest that the breeding success of ground-nesting birds in the forests of the Tatra Mountains varies strongly from year to year, depending on the abundance of rodents. Implications Increasing of rodents' density may result in lower predation pressure on eggs of ground-nesting birds. This finding may help modify recommendations for conservationists and forest managers to optimize their effort to save populations of Galliformes.";"alternative prey hypothesis; forest habitat type; predation pressure; rodent abundance; Tetrastes bonasia";2019;"WILDLIFE RESEARCH";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Whilst there is growing evidence about the potential effectiveness of some aspects of climate change adaptation, the role for site-based management to increase the resilience of vulnerable populations to climate change has been little studied. Here, we test whether such management may reduce the negative effects of unfavourable weather upon a southern range margin Welsh black grouse Tetrao tetrix population that is vulnerable to climate change. The Welsh black grouse recovery programme funded a range of interventions that contributed to a 39% population increase over 10years. One likely mechanism linking black grouse populations to climate change is the sensitivity of chicks to high June rainfall. We modelled the relationship between June rainfall and management interventions which aimed to increase breeding success (habitat management and lethal predator control) to test whether management could increase the resilience of black grouse populations to such unfavourable weather. Importantly, we found that the negative effect of June rainfall upon productivity was eliminated at sites where predator control occurred, and that productivity was maximised when predator and habitat management were combined. Active management therefore reduced the negative effects of June rainfall upon this vulnerable southern range margin black grouse population, although further work is required to quantify any limits to the success of such management. Active management should be considered as a tool for climate change adaptation in other vulnerable populations, particularly where there is limited potential for species to undergo climate-driven range changes.";NA;2019;"CLIMATIC CHANGE";"Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

For decades, field researchers have used time-depth recorders (TDRs) to understand the behavior of penguins at sea. However, zoos and aquariums have rarely used these tools, and wearing devices can potentially affect animals negatively by causing discomfort or imposing energetic costs. We evaluated the long-term behavioral responses of 27 penguins (n = 8 king penguins, Aptenodytes patagonicus; n = 3 gentoo penguins, Pygoscelis papua ellsworthi; n = 8 macaroni penguins, Eudyptes chrysolophus; and n = 8 southern rockhopper penguins, Eudyptes chrysocome) before, during, and after wearing TDRs in an ABA study design. Our novel method involved affixing the TDRs to a custom-designed cradle and securing them on the penguins using flipper bands, which the penguins were accustomed to wearing for identification. The experiment was repeated four times, and we used a total of 399.5 h of behavioral observations to evaluate the effects of the TDRs on locomotor, comfort, and social behaviors. We also conducted observations with a second set of penguins (two of each species) naive to wearing TDRs to evaluate their acute responses following application of the devices. Finally, we conducted validation tests to assess the accuracy of TDRs in a freshwater pool. Penguins observed immediately after the devices were applied to their flipper bands for the first time showed little device-directed behavior. However, there were some individual differences, suggesting that zoos and aquariums should carefully monitor initial behavioral responses to TDRs. In the long term, wearing TDRs had few effects on the behavior of the penguins. The penguins displayed almost no device-directed behavior, and there were few statistically significant differences in their behavior across the three study conditions. Seasonal changes and penguin weight likely explained the increase in movement king penguins demonstrated after wearing TDRs (F-2,F-58 = 4.34, p = 0.02). King penguins also showed a small increase in agonistic behavior while wearing TDRs (F-2,F-73 = 3.81, p = 0.03), a difference that may have been related to mating competition during the breeding season. Our results indicate that these flipper-mounted TDRs had few effects on the penguins, while providing valuable information about 24-hour use of aquatic resources in their freshwater habitats.";"Data loggers; Bio-logging; Gentoo penguin; Macaroni penguin; Rockhopper penguin; King penguin";2019;"APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE";"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Behavioral Sciences; Veterinary Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

In this light, we studied the relationships between the flocks' size of Mareca penelope and the distribution of three seagrass species (Cymodocea nodosa, Zoostera marina and Nanozostera noltei) occurring in the Marano and Grado lagoon (Northern Adriatic Sea). Twelve bird monitoring areas were monthly surveyed for 3 years whereas seagrass distribution data were collected for the whole lagoon in the following years. The overall number of individuals of M. penelope was related to seagrass meadow extension and species cover by using a multiscale approach in four circle buffers (with radius of 500, 750, 1,000 and 1,250m). Among the considered scales, the 750m radius scale showed the best performance. The overall number of M. penelope increased where the occupied area by seagrass meadows was larger. Results also showed that when C. nodosa mean percentage cover increased the number of M. penelope decreased, while if N. noltei mean percentage cover increased also M. penelope number increased. Z. marina showed a negligible influence for all the tested scales. Our findings demonstrate that M. penelope populations depend not only on the extension of seagrass meadows but also on their species assembly, evidencing that M. penelope seem to prefer N. noltei stands, avoiding meadows with high abundance of C. nodosa.";"herbivorous birds; lagoon; Mareca penelope; primary producers; seagrasses";2019;"ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH";"Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

To quantify change in fuel composition and structure in intact sagebrush ecosystems, we sampled 17years following prescribed fire in eight approximately 400ha plots (4 burned, 4 unburned control) at Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge, OR, USA. Fuels data were used to model potential fire behavior in burn and control plots across four environmental scenarios that mimic drying of fuels through the fire season. Seventeen years after fire total fuel loads were 7xhigher in controls (6015kgha(-1)) than burned plots (831kgha(-1); P<0.01). Herbaceous fuels were 5 times greater in burns (P<0. 01). Shrub fuel was nearly 10 times higher in unburned plots (P<0.01), and litter under shrubs in controls was 3.75 times greater than in burns (P<0.01). Potential fire behavior was lower in burned plots than in unburned controls across all environmental scenarios. In the driest scenario, potential rate of spread ranged from 0.4 to 1.5mmin(-1) in burns and 2.7 to 5.5mmin(-1) in controls (P<0.01). Maintaining resilience in these ecosystems at multiple spatial and temporal scales may include a consideration of the natural role of fire in good condition Wyoming big sagebrush ecosystems.

We used meta-analysis techniques to assess the effects of fire and mechanical shrub reduction over two post-treatment timeframes (1-4 and 5-10 years) on changes in cover and frequency of 15 seeded species at 63 restoration sites with high potential for recovery. Compared to mechanical treatments, fire resulted in greater increases in seeded species. Native shrubs did not increase, and forbs generally declined over time; however, large increases in perennial grasses were observed, suggesting that seeding efforts contributed to enhanced understory herbaceous conditions. We found greater increases in a few non-native species than native species across all treatments, suggesting the possibility that interference among seeded species may have influenced results of this regional assessment. Differences among treatments and species were likely driven by seedbed conditions, which should be carefully considered in restoration planning. Site characteristics also dictated seeded species responses: while forbs showed greater increases in cover over the long term at higher elevation sites considered to be more resilient to disturbance, surprisingly, shrubs and grasses had greater increases in cover and frequency at lower elevation sites where resilience is typically much lower. Further research is needed to understand the causes of forb mortality over time, and to decipher how greater increases of non-native relative to native seeded species will influence species diversity and successional trajectories of restoration sites.";"Artemisia tridentata; dryland restoration; herbaceous understory; mechanical treatment; restoration seeding; seedling establishment; shrub encroachment";2019;"RESTORATION ECOLOGY";"Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We housed Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) females in two group sizes (pairs versus groups of four) and studied the effects on their offspring under matched and mismatched conditions. We measured F1 body mass, reproduction, and plasma levels of androgens and corticosterone. F1 group housing led to an increase in body mass. In addition, F1 group housing had a positive effect on mass in daughters of pair-housed P0 females only, which were heaviest under mismatched conditions. At the time of egg collection for the F2 generation, F1 group-housed females were heavier, irrespective of the P0 treatment. F1 females in groups laid heavier eggs, with higher hatching success, and produced heavier offspring, most likely a maternal effect of F1 mass. F1 plasma hormones were affected by neither the P0 nor the F1 social environment. These results contrasted with effects in the P0 generation (reported previously), in which plasma hormone levels, but not mass, differed between social environments. This may be due to changes in adult sex ratios as P0 females were housed with males, whereas F1 females encountered males only during mating. Our study demonstrates potentially relevant mismatch effects of the social environment on F1 body mass and maternal effects on F2 offspring, but further study is needed to understand their adaptive significance and physiological mechanisms.";"Transgenerational effects; Group size; Reproductive investment; Steroid hormones; Physiology; Morphology";2019;"JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY";"Biology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Yet, previous research is biased towards the summer season. Due to greater abiotic constraints, Arctic ecosystem characteristics might be more pronounced in winter. Here we test the hypothesis that top-down species interactions prevail over bottom-up effects in Scandinavian mountain tundra (Northern Sweden) where effects of climate warming have been observed and top-down interactions are expected to strengthen. But we test this 'a priori' hypothesis in winter and throughout the 3-4 yr rodent cycle, which imposes additional pulsed resource constraints. We used snowtracking data recorded in 12 winters (2004-2015) to analyse the spatial patterns of a tundra predator guild (arctic fox Vulpes lagopus, red fox Vulpes vulpes, wolverine Gulo gulo) and small prey (ptarmigan, Lagopus spp). The a priori top-down hypothesis was then tested through structural equation modelling, for each phase of the rodent cycle. There was weak support for this hypothesis, with top-down effects only discerned on arctic fox (weakly, by wolverine) and ptarmigan (by arctic fox) at intermediate and high rodent availability respectively. Overall, bottom-up constraints appeared more influential on the winter community structure. Cold specialist predators (arctic fox and wolverine) showed variable landscape associations, while the boreal predator (red fox) appeared strongly dependent on productive habitats and ptarmigan abundance. Thus, we suggest that the unpredictability of food resources determines the winter ecology of the cold specialist predators, while the boreal predator relies on resource-rich habitats. The constraints imposed by winters and temporary resource lows should therefore counteract productivity-driven ecosystem change and have a stabilising effect on community structure. Hence, the interplay between summer and winter conditions should determine the rate of Arctic ecosystem change in the context of global warming.";"bottom-up versus top-down effect; seasonality; Arctic ecosystems";2019;"ECOGRAPHY";"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Additionally, >10 yr were required for greater survival of local populations, that is, local adaptation, to become evident. Variation in survival was best explained by the combination of populations' home ecoregion combined with grouping of minimum temperature and aridity. Additional reductions in survival were explained by ungrouped (i.e., continuous) measures of garden-to-population-origin separation in geographic distance (5% decrease in survival per 100 km increase in separation; R-2 = 0.22) and especially in minimum temperature in younger plants (-4% per + degrees C difference, R-2 = 0.56 vs. 0.29 in the 14th vs. 27th post-planting years, respectively).

Total species richness and richness of ancient semi-natural woodland plants showed signs of recovery in pens that had been disused for longer than ten years, but this recovery only occurred in pens where <= 1000 pheasants/ha had been released. Pheasant release pens are sometimes relocated within woodland to reduce disease incidence but, as the flora within disused pens does not recover quickly, this practice may cause cumulative habitat damage.

A chicken model was established by adding arsenic trioxide (As2O3; 30 mg/kg), copper sulfate (CuSO4; 300 mg/kg), and simultaneously both elements in the basal diet. After the chickens were fed for 12 weeks, a significant reduction in antioxidant enzyme levels or production of malondialdehyde (MDA) emphasized the occurrence of oxidative stress. Furthermore, an imbalance in mitochondrial dynamics along with its abnormal structure certified mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, elevated levels of pro-apoptotic and autophagy genes and decreased levels of antiapoptotic genes were found in treated groups. Karyopyknosis and chromatin peripheral condensation were accompanied by an increased apoptosis ratio, as well as accumulation of autophagosomes, thus indicating that apoptosis and autophagy are involved in immune cell death.

Moreover, in the As or Cu group, the thymus tissue suffered different susceptibilities in oxidative toxicity, which needs further study. Collectively, our results manifested that co-exposure to As and Cu increased the oxidative burden and exacerbated mitochondrial dysfunction on the thymus.

These results were compared with a group of control chickens from the same hatchery and incubator that did not go through the commercial hatchery routine. Chickens were continuously weighed, egg production data was collected and feather scoring was performed. We found that chicks have a significant increase in CORT during the hatchery process, which implies they are exposed to stress. During first weeks of life, these chicks were more fearful, had a higher CORT reactivity during restraint and weighed more than control chicks. Later in life, hatchery treated chickens had more feather damages and injuries on combs and wattles, a faster onset of egg laying and higher levels of estradiol. We conclude that processing at the commercial hatchery was a stressful event with short-and long-term effects on behaviour and stress reactivity, and potentially also positive effects on production.

To further understand the impact of these compounds on bird species and to improve risk assessment capacities, the current study determined the acute toxicities of imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam formulations on South American eared doves (Zenaida auriculata). Insecticides were administered by gavage to adult doves to determine median lethal doses (LD50) according to a standardized sequential procedure. The acute toxicity of formulated imidacloprid (LD50 = 59 mg active ingredient, a.i./kg body weight, b.w.) was much higher than that of the tested formulations of clothianidin (LD50 = 4248 mg a.i./kg b.w.) and thiamethoxam (LD50 = 4366 mg a.i./kg b.w.). Imidacloprid also differed from the other two neonicotinoids in terms of the onset and intensity of intoxication signs and the times of death and recovery. All three insecticides induced a reduction in food consumption that led to body weight loss. An average weight dove of 127 g would obtain a dose equivalent to the LD50 of imidacloprid by consuming 1.7 g of treated sorghum seeds. As eared doves offered non-treated sorghum seeds 5 h per day consumed on average 6.4 +/- 1.8 g (mean +/- S.D.), it is concluded that these doves could feasibly be exposed to lethal doses in the field.

The Tibetan Snowcock (Tetraogallus tibetanus) is a little-known phasianid distributing in alpine areas at extremely high elevations in the mountains surrounding the Tibetan Plateau. Estimating the species occupancy rate and discussing the factors affecting its distribution based on infrared-triggered camera techniques would provide both a baseline to measure the influence of global warming and valuable information on its conservation and ecology.MethodsWe used infrared-triggered cameras to investigate the Tibetan Snowcock on the western slope of Mt. Gongga from June to November 2016. We used the R package overlap to visualize its activity pattern, and used an occupancy model to both examine its habitat use as well as to determine the most influential variables affecting its habitat use.ResultsUsing 103 camera traps over 9213 camera-days, we recorded 428 instances of Tibetan Snowcock. The diel activity peaks of Tibetan Snowcock occurred during the periods of 8:0010:00 am and 18:0020:00pm. The model estimate of occupancy for Tibetan Snowcock (0.830) was slightly higher than the naive site occupancy based on camera detections (0.663), indicating a wider use of habitat than the camera traps recorded. Elevation, slope, settlement density, road density, and EVI (enhanced vegetation index) were the most influential variables for its habitat use.ConclusionsThe Tibetan Snowcock is confirmed to be diurnal. This species prefers an environment with a high elevation, gentle slope, and low EVI, apparently facing a trade-off between predator risk, foraging efficiency, and food availability. When human impact was low, there was a positive correlation between the habitat use of the Tibetan Snowcock and both its road and settlement densities. Infrared cameras and proper survey design are valuable for investigating extreme alpine phasianids.";"Activity pattern; Habitat preference; Mt; Gongga; Occupancy model; Tibetan Snowcock";2019;"AVIAN RESEARCH";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Access to nutritious foods for juveniles has important implications because poor foraging conditions during development could result in mortality, or reduced fitness in adulthood. Selection of brood-rearing habitats by female Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) thus has broad implications to survival of juveniles and persistence of populations. Previous research using crop contents demonstrated that invertebrates and forbs comprise the major portion of sage-grouse chick diets for the first few months post-hatch. We coupled stable isotope analysis of feathers and field measurements to quantify chick diet and then correlated that with measures of chick body condition. We sought to reconstruct sage-grouse chick dietary history (2013-2015) using nitrogen stable isotopes to (1) evaluate whether selection of brood-rearing habitats by female sage-grouse was related to chick diet, and (2) assess the relationship between dietary consumption and body condition. Brood-rearing females selected habitats in areas where diet resources occurred in proportion to their availability, with the exception that females selected areas with greater forbs abundance 4 weeks after hatch. Diet assimilation by chicks at brood-rearing locations was unrelated to the availability of forbs and invertebrates, but consumption of forbs increased with chick age. Chicks that assimilated proportionally greater amounts of plant-derived nitrogen in their feathers during their first week of life tended to weigh more and have longer wing chords. This relationship was similar between male and female chicks. The importance of quality foods for sage-grouse is well recognized and conservation efforts should aim to maintain functioning sagebrush ecosystems containing adequate brood-rearing habitats for juvenile sage-grouse; there remains a need to identify whether desirable effects are achievable when attempting to improve big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) habitats to benefit sage-grouse populations.";"body condition; Centrocercus urophasianus; chick diets; dietary selection; forbs; Greater Sage-Grouse; invertebrates";2019;"CONDOR";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The stock for the junglefowl introductions was captured in northern India under the direction of Gardiner Bump in areas thought to be free of hybridization with domestic Gallus gallus domesticus (Chicken).

Herein is described an optimized method to isolate embryonic tissues from quail and chickens by microsurgery and enzymatic digestion while preserving its biological properties. After isolation, tissues from both species are associated in an in vitro organotypic assay for 48 h. Quail and chicken tissues can be discriminated by distinct nuclear features and molecular markers allowing the study of the cellular cross-talk between heterospecific association of tissues. This approach is, therefore, a useful tool for studying complex tissue interactions in developmental processes with highly dynamic spatial modifications, such as those occurring during pharyngeal morphogenesis and the formation of the foregut endoderm-derived organs. This experimental approach was first developed to study the epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during early-stages of thymus formation. In this, the endoderm-derived prospective thymic rudiment and mesoderm-derived mesenchyme, were isolated from quail and chicken embryos, respectively. The capacity of the associated tissues to generate organs can be further tested by grafting them onto the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of a chicken embryo. The CAM provides nutrients and allows gas exchanges to the explanted tissues. After 10 days of in ovo development, the chimeric organs can be analyzed in the harvested explants by conventional morphological methods. This procedure also allows studying tissue-specific contributions during organ formation, from its initial development (in vitro development) to the final stages of organogenesis (in ovo development). Finally, the improved isolation method also provides three-dimensionally (3D) preserved embryonic tissues, that can also be used for high-resolution topographical analysis of tissue-specific gene-expression patterns.";"Developmental Biology; Issue 144; Embryonic tissue isolation; 3D-preserved tissues; in vitro organotypic assay; quail-chicken chimeric organ; thymus";2019;"JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS";"Multidisciplinary Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Most organisms are susceptible to landscape temperature ranges that exceed their thermal tolerance. As a result, the distribution of landscape features that mitigate thermal extremes can affect movement and space use of organisms. Using Rio Grande wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo intermedia) as a model species, we measured black bulb temperature throughout the diurnal period and identified vegetation characteristics at wild turkey locations and random landscape locations. We observed that the thermal landscape was highly heterogeneous with temperature varying up to 52 degrees C at a given ambient temperature. Vegetation type strongly influenced temperature across space during daily peak heating, with taller vegetation types (woody vegetation > 2 m) having mean temperatures up to 8.95 degrees C cooler than the remainder of the landscape. However, these cooler vegetation types were uncommon, only accounting for 8.2% of the landscape. Despite the rarity of tall woody cover, wild turkey showed strong selection for this vegetation type particularly during peak daily heating with 74.9% of locations within 18 m of tree cover. Not only did wild turkey alter space use across time relative to temperature variation, but they also altered movement. We found that on the hottest days ( >= 35 degrees C), wild turkeys decreased movement by three fold during peak heating, while movement on cooler days ( < 30 degrees C) was uniform. Collectively, our data provide evidence that space use and movement for large avian species can be influenced by the thermal environment, and that the thermal environment is an important component of habitat for a species.";"Black bulb temperature; Heterogeneity; Landscape; Meleagris gallopavo; Microclimate; Operative temperature; Rio Grande wild turkey; Thermal ecology";2019;"JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY";"Biology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Translocation has become a widely used method to restore wildlife populations following extirpation. For some species, such as lekking grouse, which breed at traditional mating grounds, reproduction is linked to culturally established geographic locations. Cultural centres are lost upon extirpation, making restoration into otherwise rehabilitated habitats especially challenging. The process by which species with culturally dependent reproduction sometimes become re-established is poorly understood and merits investigation to improve conservation strategies. Historically, population restoration of North American lekking grouse (Tympanuchus spp. and Centrocercus spp.) via translocation has yielded poor results, in part because translocation sites lack leks, culturally determined breeding locations for which breeding adults form a high degree of philopatry. Columbian sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus columbianus; CSTG) occurs in <10% of its historic range, but the existence of rehabilitated historic habitat provides for the potential of population restoration via translocation. Aims. We reintroduced CSTG to vacant habitat in north-central Nevada, USA, from 2013 to 2017, with concordant goals of promoting females to nest and males to lek. We tested the utility of performing artificial insemination (AI) on females before translocation and we conducted paternity analyses to understand male reproduction. Methods. We monitored females for the effects of AI on nest initiation, nest survival and egg fertility. We used post-hatch extra-embryonic membranes and other tissues to evaluate paternity of chicks produced at the restoration site. Key results. Artificial insemination had no effect on female survival or nest initiation, and did not fertilise any eggs within nine sampled clutches (n = 102 eggs). Most paternity was attributable to male residents that had survived for >= 1 year at the restoration site before the arrival of translocated females. Conclusions. Artificial insemination neither aided nor harmed female reproduction. A small number of translocated, resident adult males sired reproduction following female release. Implications. The presence of resident males at restoration sites may be more likely to result in post-translocation reproduction than is pre-translocation AI. Restoring CSTG to vacant habitat should focus on translocating females into suitable nesting habitat while simultaneously ensuring that reproductively capable males are available within or adjacent to the nesting habitat.";"conservation ecology; conservation genetics; conservation management; management strategies; population management; radio telemetry; reproductive behaviour; threatened species; wildlife management";2019;"WILDLIFE RESEARCH";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

This raises the possibility that rhythm is a separate ability that might have evolved earlier than song. We asked whether nearly completely naive domestic chicks perceive rhythm and respond in specific ways to different rhythmic patterns. To do so, specific constituent parameters of rhythmicity were used based on the sound of a natural mother hen's cluck. The sound samples created ranged from a continuous sound to articulated rhythmic patterns of alternating strong and weak events. Chicks' reactivity to the patterns was tested over a series of sound exposure experiments by their propensity to operate a running wheel toward the acoustic source, a paradigm simulating chicks' natural affiliative response to the hen's call. Results showed that motor activity increased markedly when acoustic events were discrete (compared with continuous), and significantly when accent structure was faster (compared with slower rates). Similar to human infants, chicks showed a significant preference for pulsed over continuous patterns.

Understanding the use of research-based knowledge in conservation conflicts";"The way in which research-based knowledge is used, interpreted and communicated by different actors can influence the dynamics of conservation conflicts. The conflict that occurs between grouse shooting interests and the conservation of birds of prey in Scotland is notoriously complex, involving multiple actors at multiple levels, and shaped by the values and world views of these actors. This paper explores how research-based knowledge is used in the debate by six key organisations, and looks to understand the drivers that may influence knowledge use and interpretation in this, and other, cases of conservation conflict. Research was used to both legitimise and reinforce certain world views, and to support associated political actions that would cause these to become reality. Actors offered divergent interpretations of the same piece of research, emphasising different findings and outcomes. Research-based knowledge was thus employed by actors to support or counter the 'status quo', and challenge other claims that clashed with their own values. Although the intention of such knowledge use is unclear, the selective reconstruction of research by actors could stem from, and reiterate, divergent value systems. This may pose significant challenges to conflict mitigation efforts; whilst some may look to research-based knowledge as the bringer of truth, its interpretation by different actors may exacerbate existing rifts between stakeholders; promoting polarisation of views. Mitigation strategies should be sensitive to this, and aim to improve the inclusiveness and transparency of the knowledge transfer process.";"Conservation conflicts; Conflict mitigation; Knowledge use; Land use; Environmental management";2019;"JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT";"Environmental Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

If stress occurs during reproduction, the resulting offspring can show altered phenotypes that are thought to arise from increased exposure to maternal glucocorticoids. Developing offspring can metabolize maternal glucocorticoids, which can alter the pattern of exposure they encounter. For egg laying vertebrates, we are just beginning to understand how embryonic steroid metabolism impacts embryonic exposure to maternal glucocorticoids. Here we injected three doses of radioactive corticosterone into Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) eggs to determine the degree of embryonic exposure at days six and nine of development. We found that increasing injection dose increased the amount of radioactivity found in the embryo at day six but by day nine the effect of injection dose disappeared as the amount of radioactivity within the embryo dropped to equivalent levels for all three doses. Interestingly, when examined as a percentage of initial dose, there were no differences between treatment groups at any time points. Importantly, using thin-layer chromatography we characterized that some free steroid, putatively identified as corticosterone, does reach the developing embryo. Together, our data suggest that the in ovo metabolism of maternal corticosterone can eventually eliminate it from the egg, but before this happens, embryos developing in eggs with elevated amounts of maternal corticosterone are exposed to higher levels early in development. This has important implications for how we understand the developmental steroid environment and the mechanisms underlying maternal stress effects.";"Glucocorticoids; Maternal effects; Developmental endocrinology; Corticosterone; Avian; Stress";2019;"GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY";"Endocrinology & Metabolism; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

In Pakistan it occurs in a wide range of rough, sloping and dry regions rising to the higher foothill valleys of the internal Himalayan ranges and western Himalayas and plains, Balochistan, and dry hillsides of the Punjab and Sindh. It is the ""National Bird"" of Pakistan, however, very little is known about its ecology and breeding in its native range in the north of the country. The present study investigated breeding ecology of the bird in its native range of Lower Dir district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province from September 2016 to August 2017. Results show that breeding season of the species starts from February: peak breeding months being March and April, during which frequent breeding calls were heard. The calling frequency ranged from 0.15 per minute to 0.3 per minute. Six active nests of Chukor were found at five different sampling sites; nest location was mostly on sloping areas under sanatha Dodonaea viscosa shrubs. Nesting material consisted of dry leaves of annual grass Poa annua, small twigs of bushes and downy feathers. The depth of nest ranged between 5-10 cm. Clutch size ranged from 8-20 eggs while the incubation period was found to be 22-24 days. Hatching success was up to 85% (range 75 to 85%) in different nests. The dense vegetation consisting of Dodonaea viscosa and Poa annua provided shelter, cover and abundant supply of insects to the chicks. The study concludes that the breeding season of Chukor partridge in Dir Lower starts from February and lasts up to July, with successful nesting, egg laying and hatching.";"Chukor; Partridge; Breeding; Clutch; Incubation; Hatching";2019;"PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY";"Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Parasites benefit by increased reproduction, without costs of parental care for the parasitic eggs. CBP occurs in many egg-laying animals, among birds most often in species with large clutches and self-feeding young: two major factors facilitating successful parasitism. CBP is particularly common in waterfowl (Anatidae), a group with female-biased natal philopatry and locally related females. Theory suggests that relatedness between host and parasite can lead to inclusive fitness benefits for both, but if host costs are high, parasites should instead target unrelated females. Pairwise relatedness (r) in host-parasite (h-p) pairs of females has been estimated using molecular genetic methods in seven waterfowl (10 studies). In many h-p pairs, the two females were unrelated (with low r, near the local population mean). However, close relatives (r = 0.5) were over-represented in h-p pairs, which in all 10 studies had higher mean relatedness than other females. In one species where this was studied, h-p relatedness was higher than between nesting close neighbours, and hosts parasitized by non-relatives aggressively rejected other females. In another species, birth nest-mates (mother-daughters, sisters) associated in the breeding area as adults, and became h-p pairs more often than expected by chance. These and other results point to recognition of birth nest-mates and perhaps other close relatives. For small to medium host clutch sizes, addition of a few parasitic eggs need not reduce host offspring success. Estimates in two species suggest that hosts can then gain inclusive fitness if parasitized by relatives. Other evidence of female cooperation is incubation by old eider Somateria mollissima females of clutches laid by their relatives, and merging and joint care of broods of young. Merging females tended to be more closely related. Eiders associate with kin in many situations, and in some geese and swans, related females may associate over many years. Recent genetic evidence shows that also New World quails (Odontophoridae) have female-biased natal philopatry, CBP and brood merging, inviting further study and comparison with waterfowl. Kin-related parasitism also occurs in some insects, with revealing parallels and differences compared to birds. In hemipteran bugs, receiving extra eggs is beneficial for hosts by diluting offspring predation. In eggplant lace bugs Gargaphia solani, host and parasite are closely related, and kin selection favours egg donation to related females. Further studies of kinship in CBP, brood merging and other contexts can test if some of these species are socially more advanced than presently known.";"alternative reproductive tactics; brood merging; conspecific brood parasitism; cooperation; inclusive fitness; kin selection; spatial kin structure; birds; insects; waterfowl";2019;"BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS";"Biology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

One courtship behavior is vocalization (gobbling), which attracts females and signals dominance to other males. However, temporal variation in gobbling activity may be influenced by external stimuli, environmental variation, and hunter activity. Gobbling activity is a key determinant of hunter satisfaction, and gobbling chronology is often used by state agencies to inform regulatory processes. To identify factors influencing gobbling activity, we evaluated daily gobbling chronology on 3 sites in South Carolina, USA (Webb Wildlife Management Area [WMA] Complex, Savannah River Site, Crackerneck WMA) with different levels of hunter activity. We used autonomous recording units (ARUs; n = 45) across 8,280 days to collect 53,937 hours of ambient sound recordings and identified 68,426 gobbles. Gobbling activity varied daily and site interacting with minutes since sunrise best predicted daily gobbling activity. We noted distinct differences in predicted numbers of gobbles between hunted sites and an unhunted site, suggesting that hunting may be an important determinant of gobbling activity. Across our study sites, we observed that >= 72% of gobbling activity occurred between 30 minutes before and 60 minutes after sunrise. We found no clear evidence of well-defined unimodal or bimodal peaks in daily or weekly gobbling activity. Across sites, <44% of gobbling activity occurred during legal hunting seasons in South Carolina, with between 30% and 48% of gobbling activity occurring after legal hunting seasons. Because hunter satisfaction is primarily influenced by gobbling activity, wildlife managers in South Carolina may consider adjusting dates of turkey hunting seasons to correspond hunting with periods when most gobbling occurs.

Striking similarities amongst a range of unrelated domesticated species suggest that similar regulatory mechanisms may underlie the domesticated phenotype. These include color pattern, growth, reproduction, development and stress response. Although previous studies have focused on the brain to find mechanisms underlying domestication, the potential role of the pituitary gland as a target of domestication is highly overlooked. Here, we study gene expression in the pituitary gland of the domesticated White Leghorn chicken and its wild ancestor, the Red Junglefowl. By overlapping differentially expressed genes with a previously published list of functionally important genes in the pituitary gland, we narrowed down to 34 genes. Amongst them, expression levels of genes with inhibitory function on pigmentation (ASIP), main stimulators of metabolism and sexual maturity (TSHB and DIO2), and a potential inhibitor of broodiness (PRLR), were higher in the domesticated breed. Additionally, expression of 2 key inhibitors of the stress response (NR3C1, CRHR2) was higher in the domesticated breed. We suggest that changes in the transcription of important modulatory genes in the pituitary gland can account not only for domestication of the stress response in domestic chickens, but also for changes in pigmentation, development, and reproduction. Given the pivotal role of the pituitary gland in the regulation of multiple shared domesticated traits, we suggest that similar changes in pituitary transcriptome may contribute to the domesticated phenotype in other species as well.";NA;2019;"HEREDITY";"Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Nonbreeding song sparrows had more fat and muscle, as well as a ketone and triglyceride profile suggesting a greater reliance on lipid reserves.

Nonbreeding birds had more NPY immunoreactivity, specifically in three brain regions: lateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and ventral tegmental area.

The Common quail (Cotumix cotumix) provides an exception to this trend and its populations have remained stable over the last two decades. However, some basic facts regarding quail biology and ecology, such as the geographic distribution of age and sex classes during the summer, remain poorly understood. We analyzed 43,194 Spanish quail ringing records from 1961 to 2014 to assess the effects of geography and weather conditions on the probability that individuals will be ringed during the various stages of their annual cycle (arrival -spring migration-, stationary breeding period, departure -autumn migration- and winter) for the different quail age-sex classes over time. We found that spatial distribution of the age and sex classes can be explained by date, latitude, longitude, altitude, rainfall, and temperature. Our results suggest that date accounts for most of the variation in the distribution of quail age classes, followed by the weather variables, and then latitude, and altitude. Similarly, date also accounts for most of the variation in the distribution of the two sexes. These results could partially explain why this species has avoided population decline, since its ecological strategy is based on its temporal and spatial distribution combined with the segregation of age and sex groups. We hypothesize that the distribution of quail age and sex classes follows variations in weather and habitat suitability to exploit seasonal and geographic variations in resource availability. The migratory and nomadic movements of quail, combined with the occurrence of multiple breeding attempts within a single season, may also allow these birds to overcome the impacts of predators and anthropogenic environmental change. Conservation and management efforts should therefore take account of these age and sex related temporal and spatial patterns. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Some tetranoids (grouse spp.) species are particularly vulnerable to tall anthropogenic structures because they evolved in ecosystems void of vertical structures. In western North America, electric power transmission and distribution lines (power lines) occur in sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) landscapes within the range of the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recommended using buffer zones near leks to mitigate the potential impacts of power lines on sage-grouse. However, recommended buffer distances are inconsistent across state and federal agencies because data are lacking. To address this, we evaluated the effects of power lines on sage-grouse breeding ecology within Utah, portions of southeastern Idaho, and southwestern Wyoming from 1998-2013. Overall, power lines negatively affected lek trends up to a distance of 2.7 and 2.8 km, respectively. Power lines died not affect lek persistence. Female sage-grouse avoided transmission lines during the nesting and brooding seasons at distances up to 1.1 and 0.8 km, respectively. Nest and brood success were negatively affected by transmission lines up to distances of 2.6 and 1.1 km, respectively. Distribution lines did not appear to affect sage-grouse habitat selection or reproductive fitness. Our analyses demonstrated the value of sagebrush cover in mitigating potential power line impacts. Managers can minimize the effects of new transmission power lines by placing them in existing anthropogenic corridors and/or incorporating buffers at least 2.8 km from active leks. Given the uncertainty we observed in our analyses regarding sage-grouse response to distribution lines coupled with their role in providing electric power service directly to individual consumers, we recommend that buffers for these power lines be considered on a case-by-case basis.

However, its role in sperm biotechnologies is scarce in poultry. The aims of the present study were to study the amino acids profile and total proteins of seminal plasma in 12 Spanish chicken breeds and to investigate the role of seminal plasma on cryoresistance of rooster sperm. To investigate the role of seminal plasma on cryoresistance, diluted pooled semen samples were cryopreserved in the presence and absence of seminal plasma. Glutamic acid was the most abundant free amino acid in seminal plasma, followed by alanine, serine, valine, and glycine. There was an influence of breed (P<0.05) on the percentage of viable sperm after freezing-thawing of samples with seminal plasma. Cluster analysis revealed that White Prat, Black Castellana, Blue Andaluza, Quail Castellana, and Red-Barred Vasca returned the best freezing-thawing response (good freezers). There was a positive correlation between seminal plasma concentrations of valine, isoleucine lysine, leucine and post thaw viability. The evaluation of fertilization capacity of frozen-thawed semen from the breeds White Prat ('good freezer') and Black-Red Andaluza ('bad freezer') showed that good freezer had higher fertility (20/68, 29.4%) compared to bad freezer breed (14/76, 18.4%), even if the difference was not significant (P = 0.08).

To achieve synchrony with the fluctuating environment, organisms have evolved with time-tracking mechanism commonly known as biological clocks. This circadian clock machinery has been identified in almost all cells of vertebrates and categorized as central and peripheral clocks. In birds, three independent circadian clocks reside within the nervous tissues in the hypothalamus, pineal and retina, which interact with each other and produce circadian time at a functional level. There is limited knowledge available of the molecular clockwork, and of integration between central and peripheral clocks in birds. Here, we studied daily expression of canonical clock genes (Bmal1, Clock, Per2, Per3, Cry1 and Cry2) and clock-controlled gene (Npas2) in all three central tissues (hypothalamus, pineal and retina) and in peripheral tissues (liver, intestine and muscle). Wild caught adult male tree sparrows were exposed to equinox photoperiod (12L:12D) for 2 weeks and after that birds were sacrificed (N = 5 per time point) at six time points (ZT1, ZT5, ZT9, ZT13, ZT17 and ZT21; ZT0 is lights on). Daily expression of clock genes was studied using qPCR. Bmal1, Clock, Per2, Per3, Cry1, Cry2 and Npas2 showed daily oscillation in all tissues except Cry2 in hypothalamus, pineal and intestine. We observed tissue-specific expression pattern for all clock and clock-controlled genes. Bmal1 transcripts expressed during early phase of night. Clock acrophase was observed during middle or late day time in the central clock while during early-to-middle phase of night in peripheral tissues. Npas2 expression pattern was similar to Bmal1. Per genes peaked either late at night or early during day time. However, Cry genes were peaked either at late day time (Cry1in retina, liver and intestine; Cry2 in liver and intestine) or at early night phase (Cry1 in hypothalamus, pineal and muscle; Cry2 in hypothalamus, pineal, retina and muscle). Our results are consistent with the autoregulatory circadian feedback loop, and suggest a conserved tissue-level circadian time generation in tree sparrows. Change in peak expression timing of these genes in different tissues implicates tissue-specific contribution of individual clock genes in the circadian time generation.";"Tree sparrow; circadian; clock genes; hypothalamus; pineal; retina; liver; intestine; muscle; oscillation";2019;"CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL";"Biology; Physiology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Presumably, poor recruitment due to high predation of nests and chicks is one important causal factor. In a southeastern Norwegian forested landscape (Fjella), we provided diversionary food to predators - directed mainly at the red fox Vulpes vulpes - during the nesting and early brood season of capercaillie Tetrao urogallus and black grouse T. tetrix in three nearby areas. In Eidsberg, where populations were censused during 33 years (1985-2017), food was provided during the last 22 years. In two other areas, a six-year experimental program was conducted (2003-2008) by providing food in one area for three years, then switching feeding to the other area for three years. During May and June, 10 kg of food - mainly moose offal and ungulate carcasses - was deposited at feeding stations once a week. In Eidsberg, black grouse breeding success increased by 43% after feeding was initiated, mainly due to larger brood sizes. In capercaillie, overall breeding success tended to increase, solely due to more females successfully rearing chicks. In the experimental areas, feeding increased breeding success an estimated 57% in black grouse. In capercaillie there was also a tendency for a positive effect, but sample sizes were too small for statistical inference. No increases were detected in adult birds. However, in capercaillie, increased breeding success after feeding led to a significant skew in sex ratio favouring males. A similar tendency in black grouse suggested source-sink dynamics and a net loss of young females during natal dispersal. We conclude that diversionary feeding of foxes in spring and early summer might be a feasible management tool to increase the reproductive output in local grouse populations, but that it needs to be implemented on a larger scale in order to improve breeding numbers.";"black grouse; boreal forest; capercaillie; predator control; reproduction";2019;"WILDLIFE BIOLOGY";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

However, only a proportion of birds available to count are detected resulting in a biased population index. We designed a study using an aerial integrated infrared imaging system (AIRIS) and experimental pseudo-leks to quantify sightability (proportion of birds detected) of conventional ground-based visual (GBV) surveys for greater sage-grouse Centrocercus urophasianus. Specifically, we calibrated AIRIS at pseudo-leks composed of known numbers of captively-raised birds, primarily ring-necked pheasant Phasianus colchicus. We then carried out AIRIS and GBV surveys, simultaneously, on nearby sage-grouse leks, allowing us to model AIRIS and GBV sightability. AIRIS detected similar to 93% of birds on pseudo-leks while GBV detected similar to 86% of sage-grouse on leks. Thus, the ground count observation error was -14% from the 'true' number of male sage-grouse attending the leks. We also found sagebrush cover decreased sightability for GBV counts but did not influence sightability by AIRIS. Because standard GBV protocols typically make repeated counts of sage-grouse in a single morning, we also modeled repeated GBV counts using N-mixture models and found an 88% sightability, which was nearly the same as GBV sightability from the AIRIS analysis. This suggests that the use of repeated morning counts can potentially account for imperfect detection in the standard GBV surveys currently implemented. We also provide generalized correction values that could be employed by resource managers using either GBV or AIRIS to better estimate 'true' numbers of sage-grouse attending leks within similar environments to this study. The findings and interpretation presented can help guide effective monitoring protocols that account for observation error and improve accuracy of data used for population trend and abundance estimation.";"aerial survey; Centrocercus urophasianus; detection; greater sage-grouse; infrared; lek counts; N-mixture model; observation error; sightability";2019;"WILDLIFE BIOLOGY";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The annual change (first difference) in ln-transformed black grouse Tetrao tetrix and capercaillie T. urogallus hunting statistic indices from southern Norway 1999-2017 was positively related to the mean June temperature, which is assumed to have a direct positive impact on chick survival.

The Siamese fireback (Lophura diardi), a lowland pheasant species found in mainland Southeast Asia, has mostly been studied in its areas of range expansion in submontane forests. However, there is limited information on the species' ranging behaviour and habitat use in their lowland habitat. We investigated the ranging behaviour, patterns of habitat use, and roost site selection using radio telemetry in a small and well-protected lowland forest in northeastern Thailand. The home range size was slightly larger during the non-breeding season (26.4 +/- 3.9 SE ha) than during the breeding season (20.8 +/- 2.3 SE ha). The birds selected areas with high free density at 3-5 m height, sparse tree coverage at 0.5-3 m height and high climber density in proximity to water sources. In addition, the Siamese fireback appeared to prefer roost sites on steeper slopes with less canopy cover, presumably to facilitate escape by flushing during attempted predation.

We investigated how forest structure, predator distribution, and nest location contribute to nest predation risk, and whether lower predation probabilities characterize formerly ""safe"" sites. We distributed 304 artificial ground and tree nests in a forest landscape, following the previous year locations of forest grouse observations (with and without broods). We modelled nest predation incidence using generalized mixed models; we also identified potential nest predators by tooth/bill marks on plasticine eggs. We found complex habitat effects: nest predation depended non-linearly on the stand age (low risk in post-clear-cut stands; peak values in middle-aged stands) and there were no simple relationships with predator proximity or nest concealment. Predation probabilities were higher in tree nests than in ground nests, and did not differ in the locations where broods had been observed or not. The results can be partly explained by the behaviour of the most frequent nest predator species, the pine marten, that forages both on the ground and in the canopy and avoids open areas. We suggest that large-scale modifications in forest age structure can alter not only landscape-scale predation pressure on bird nests, but also small-scale distribution and predictability of the predation, which can explain declining numbers of forest-specialist bird species.";NA;2019;"ORNIS FENNICA";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The lack of the necessity of conventional reinforcement for imprinting, however, does not mean that such reinforcement is unimportant. The evidence presented here shows that an imprinting object rapidly acquires high attractiveness to young chicks when it is associated with food provisioning. Domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, were first exposed to two different imprinting objects in the absence of any reinforcement. Subsequently, two groups of chicks received a single feeding session wherein they were provided with prey from one of the imprinting objects. A third group served as a control in which the chicks were exposed to one of the imprinting objects and prey delivery in an unpaired way. Finally, all chicks received two choice tests to assess their preferences for the two imprinting objects. The chicks that received food from an imprinting object strongly preferred that object to the alternative familiar-only object, and preferred the familiar-only object to a novel object. The control group did not show any preference between the two imprinting objects, but preferred the unpaired imprinting object to a novel object.

The first clathrochelate complexes of iron (IV) are infinitely stable in water and readily available from simple, commercially available, inexpensive source materials with surprisingly mild reaction conditions. To create new drugs on their bases, research on their toxicity is required. In this study, the results of preclinical studies of a new iron clathrochelates drug are presented. Experiments were carried out on white rats and quails, which in the previous experiment were divided into five experimental and two control groups. The solution of iron clathrochelate complexes was administered intragastrically in doses 50, 500, 1000, 2000 and 5000 mg/kg, respectively. Our results have shown that there were no grounds for using rats in the advanced experiment because the conducted research has established that iron clathrochelate is non toxic to rats. Thus, the minimum dose of iron clathrochelate complexes did not cause death of quails, and the largest dose caused 100% mortality. The basic experiment was conducted on 6 groups of birds, each consisting of 7 quails. The drug was administered in the following doses: 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000 mg/kg. The monitoring observation of the laboratory birds lasted for 14 days. It has been established that the average lethal dose of clathrochelate of the investigated drug for internal administration in quails is 764 +/- 33 mg/kg. According to the classification of chemicals by the degree of danger (State ST 12.1.007-76), iron (IV) clathrochelate complexes correspond to the third class of hazard, and according to the classification of substances for toxicity they are classified as category 4 (low toxicity substances).

In 1786 banned the breeding of wild boar in freedom in the whole of Austria-Hungary. This action has caused a strong reduction in the number of wild boar throughout Central Europe. In the Czech Republic population growth began in the 1980s. In 2017, a record number of this game was hunted, namely 230,035 (an average of 33 ind./1000 ha). In some areas, up to 86 ind./1000 ha were killed. The increase in the hunting bag of wild boars is more than a thousand times higher in the Czech Republic since the end of World War II. The number of wild boars significantly affects small game species (brown hare, pheasant, rabbit, grey partridge) in the Czech Republic. The bigger hunting bags of wild boar were in hunting grounds, the smaller the number (or hunting) of small game there was found. Statistically significantly more (p <0.05) small game was counted in hunting grounds, where the wild boar were shot down to 20 ind./1000 ha. Conversely, the level of the hunting bag of the wild boar did not have a negative effect on the hunting rate of roe deer. The more wild boars were hunted, the more roe deer were hunted in the hunting grounds. In hunting grounds, where up to20 wild boars per 1000 ha were hunted, significantly fewer (p <0.05) roe deer was hunted than in other hunting grounds. On the contrary, in hunting grounds where more than 80 wild boars per 1000 ha were hunted, significantly more roe deer were hunted (p <0.05). When we analyzed the impact of the environment on the level of the wild boar hunting bags, it was found that in hunting grounds with a proportion of farmed land up to 40% there were hunted significantly more (p <0.05) wild boars than in hunting grounds with a larger proportion of farmland. On the other hand, in hunting grounds with forest representation up to 40%, significantly fewer (p <0.05) wild boars were hunted, than in hunting grounds with a larger proportion of the forest.

So far we have assumed that nest-predating birds are visually oriented while mammal predators to a large extent use scent and auditory cues like nestling begging calls. To evaluate how important nestling begging calls are for corvid nest predators searching for nests, I used artificial nests, which made it possible to find the real costs of the begging without mitigation by parental and nestling behavior. I used paired artificial nests, one with and one without nestling begging call playback. Within 10 days, 62.9% of the nests were predated. The analyses showed that nests with begging calls suffered a significantly higher predation rate than nests without begging calls, especially when the nests were placed close to corvid nests. Moreover, nests with begging calls were predated significantly earlier than nests without begging calls. In artificial nest pairs with both nests predated but on different days, nests with begging calls were predated first. In nest pairs with only one predated nest, nests with begging calls were predated most often. This experiment shows that nestling begging calls imply a cost in terms of increased and earlier nest predation, and that corvids use nestling begging calls as a cue to find and depredate bird nests, challenging earlier expectations.";"Begging calls; behavioral ecology; Corvus comix; Cyanistes caeruleus; nest predation; Pica pica; predator cognition; predator-prey interaction; urban rural";2019;"ANIMAL BIOLOGY";"Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Some grouse species are important game birds, but many populations are red-listed at the national level. In consequence, predator control is often conducted as a grouse conservation measure, but remains a contentious issue, also because evidence of its effectiveness is lacking. Here, we review the evidence on predation as a limiting factor for grouse populations and perform a quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of predator control to benefit grouse population parameters. We found support that grouse populations appear to be typically limited by their predators. Predator control was associated with an overall positive effect size on grouse population parameters (i.e. mean of 1.43 times the reference value, 95% CI of 1.22-1.68). We found positive effect sizes for most population parameters (reproductive success; adult abundance and survival), but not all (brood size, nest success).

The use of canonical correlation analysis in biological studies about revealing the relations of quantitative characteristics can provide additional information to the investigator. In this study, total of 146 meat type female quails were used. 13 eggs were collected from each of 15 -week-old and pedigree raised quails. Four of these eggs were used for egg quality characteristics, 5 for chick quality characteristics analysis and 4 for egg protein analysis. The egg quality characteristics that are discussed in the research are; egg weight (EW), shape index (SI), shell weight (SW), albumen weight (AW), yolk weight (YW), albumen density (AD), yolk density (YD), and egg crude protein (CP) content. Chick quality features are; hatching weight (HW), daily chick weight (CW) and chick length (CL). As a result of the research, high canonical correlations (0.907) between egg quality characteristics and chick quality characteristics were determined. When egg quality characteristics are supposed as independent variables (X) and chick quality characteristics dependent variables (Y), 82.30% of the total variation in the Y variable set can be explained by the X variable set. This suggests that egg quality characteristics are likely to be determinants of chick quality characteristics. In the formation of the canonical variables in the egg quality traits set, the albumen weight had the highest contribution as the original values whereas in chick quality traits set, chick weight had the highest additive value.";"Canonical correlation; quail; egg quality; chick quality";2019;"FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN";"Environmental Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Trade-offs among source, captive, and target wild populations are expected when optimizing the use of the last few remaining individuals of a population. Yet few analyses are conducted to optimize the choice of source population from which animals are collected and released. Using linked scenarios, we evaluated the risks and rewards of collection, ex situ rearing, and release of endangered Greater Sage-grouse in Canada. We integrated demographic rates from captive populations with wild population abundance, demography, and habitat relationships in a spatially explicit individual-based model framework for multiple populations across national and international borders. We quantified the potential for released birds to improve wild abundance and reduce extinction risk in two target wild populations. To gain general insight, we compared risks and rewards among different source and target population sizes and trajectories. The risks caused by removing individuals from the wild depended on the number of animals removed, and source abundance and trajectory, and were partially obscured by stochasticity. Releases into small and rapidly declining populations provided the greatest near-term reductions in extinction risk, but improvements were short-term. Yet releases into larger and more stable populations resulted in longer lasting conservation benefits than in more vulnerable populations but required greater initial release effort. Systematic modeling approaches that evaluate a spectrum of trade-offs and quantify conservation risks and benefits can help direct the expectations and effort invested in captive breeding and release programs.

Identifying the similarity among seasonal habitats will assist conservationists in prioritizing specific requirements. Habitat similarity presumably falls along a gradient depending on the degree to which a species is migratory. How migratory a population is may even vary considerably within a species. A partially migratory species of conservation concern is the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), where breeding habitat has been prioritized. Our goal was to determine if a more migratory sage-grouse population required a different habitat conservation strategy to meet its comprehensive requirements than a less migratory population. Firstly, even though our study populations differed in behavior they both reflected what was expected for partially migratory populations with seasonal habitats that on average had a moderate degree of similarity. This suggests that prioritizing the conservation of one seasonal habitat will result in partly protecting other seasonal requirements but not completely meet all requirements. Secondly, for both populations, prioritization of breeding habitat was justified because breeding habitat was most like other seasonal requirements. Thirdly, information specific to each study population was necessary to identify the importance of prioritizing additional seasonal habitat with a greater need to include summer and winter habitat for the more migratory population. We created a cumulative habitat prediction map that depicts comprehensive habitat requirements to help guide reserve delineation. This process can be used to delineate priority areas for conservation reserves for other partially migratory species. (C) 2019 The Authors.

This fact is also valid for meat type quail populations which are subjected to the genetic breeding program. It is a subject of research that T. molitor can be a good alternative protein source. This research elucidated the effects of 10 % T. molitor addition as protein resource to quail diet on weight gains, feed intake and feed consumptions on weekly basis by comparing with control (soybean meal as main protein resource in diet). In addition, genetic parameters were estimated for weight gain and feed conversion rate characteristics. Total of 294 Japanese quails obtained from 50 full-sib families were used in this study. The overall mean weight gain was 27.7, 44.7, 60.7, 54.9 and 39.3 g at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 weeks of age, respectively. The overall average feed intake in the end of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 weeks were 50.5, 109.7, 112.0, 138.7 and 198.7 g per week, respectively, whereas the feed conversion rates for respective growth periods were 1.90, 2.52, 1.90, 2.59 and 6.04. T. molitor added 10% to the ration, resulted in a lower weight gain in the first three weeks of experiment comparing to the control group. However, this event does not apply to the later stages of growth period. The T molitor addition into the ration led to a decrease in feed consumption after 3 weeks of age without any loss of growth performance. In this case, the feed conversion rates of birds at 4 and 5 weeks of age were lower for the T. molitor group. The heritability estimates for weight gain at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 weeks were 0.78, 0.55, 0.74, 0.53 and 0.21 respectively whereas those of the feed conversion rates were 0.64, 0.50, 0.69, 0.43 and 0.06.

Birds have sophisticated seasonal mechanisms and are therefore excellent models for studying these phenomena. Birds perceive light via deep-brain photoreceptors and long day-induced thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, thyrotropin) in the pars tuberalis of the pituitary gland (PT), which cause local thyroid hormone activation within the mediobasal hypothalamus. The local bioactive thyroid hormone controls seasonal gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion and subsequent gonadotropin secretion. In mammals, the eyes are believed to be the only photoreceptor organ, and nocturnal melatonin secretion triggers an endocrine signal that communicates information about the photoperiod to the PT to regulate TSH. In contrast, in Salmonidae fish the input pathway to the neuroendocrine output pathway appears to be localized in the saccus vasculosus.

In rats and birds, activation of mu-opioid receptors (MOR) and dopamine Dl receptors in the medial preoptic area (mPOA) often have opposing effects on sexual behavior, yet mechanisms by which the mPOA integrates these opposing effects to modulate behavior remain unknown. Here, we used male European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) to provide insight into the hypothesis that MOR and Dl receptors modify sexual behavior seasonally by altering activity in the same neurons in the mPOA. To do this, using fluorescent immunohistochemistry, we examined the extent to which MOR and Dl receptors co-localize in mPOA neurons and the degree to which photoperiod and the sex-steroid hormone testosterone alter co-localization. We found that MOR and Dl receptors co-localize throughout the mPOA and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, a region also implicated in the control of sexual behavior. Numbers of single and co-labeled MOR and Dl receptor labeled cells were higher in the rostral mPOA in photosensitive males (a condition observed just prior to the breeding season) compared to photosensitive males treated with testosterone (breeding season condition). In the caudal mPOA co-localization of MOR and Dl receptors was highest in photosensitive males compared to photorefractory males (a post-breeding season condition).

In the United States, population declines of many early successional bird species have been linked with habitat loss due to agriculture. In light of this, recent efforts have attempted to prioritize conservation actions at continental scales. Importantly, these efforts have used existing data to estimate the global population size for declining species and set future population goals. Though these efforts consider broad scales for conservation efforts and provide population targets, they lack explicit plans to achieve established goals. One way to achieve these population goals is through the process of habitat restoration, such as voluntary private-land conservation programs that restore habitat in agricultural landscapes and are implemented at a sufficiently large scale to achieve population goals. Our goal was to understand how private-land conservation programs can be used to achieve population goals for declining species. To do this, we examined the population-level impacts of the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, a program that has created more than 57,000 ha of restored habitat in Illinois, for four declining conservation priority species, the Bell's Vireo (Vireo bellii bellii), Field Sparrow (Spizella pusilla), Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), and Willow Flycatcher (Empidonax trailli trailli). We surveyed 172 randomly chosen restored fields in 10 counties in central and west-central Illinois during the 2012-2015 breeding seasons. We found that current private-land conservation efforts in Illinois are probably effective in achieving state population goals for rare species with restricted habitat preferences such as the Bell's Vireo and may be close to achieving the goal for the Willow Flycatcher. However, more than 10 times the current amount of restored habitat (similar to 1% of land used for agriculture in Illinois) would be required to achieve the population goals set for all of our focal species. Our results suggest that achieving population goals for early successional bird species using land restored through private-land programs may be possible for some rare species, but the large amount of habitat needed for many species makes achieving these goals only possible with significant increases in private-land habitat.";"conservation action; conservation goals; conservation planning; early successional habitat; private-land programs";2019;"ECOSPHERE";"Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Capital breeders utilise stored endogenous resources (typically lipids) to finance reproduction, whereas income breeders use exogenous resources (typically carbohydrates). The basis for such characterisation has mainly come from studying females, yet for many species, male and female reproductive success may be determined by substantially different factors. Females allocate resources to offspring production, whereas males typically allocate resources to accessing mating opportunities, e.g. from contests or displays. The primary metabolic fuel (lipids or carbohydrates) in males appears to be dependent on the type of activity being performed (i.e. high versus low intensity or long versus short duration), rather than capital or income breeding strategy per se. Males performing sustained, long-duration effort typically utilise lipids, whereas those undergoing intense activity more often utilise carbohydrates. As a result, either fuel type can be used in either strategy. Breeding season duration can constrain strategy choice; lipids and carbohydrates can be used in short breeding season species, but only lipids provide a viable fuel source for long breeding season capital breeders. Both capital- and income-breeding males must manage their resource use during the breeding season, but capital breeders must also cope with physiological stressors associated with extended fasting. Overall, the capital-income breeding concept applies equally to male reproduction, but compared with females, there are different physical and physiological constraints that shape choice of strategy. This Commentary also highlights some key future areas that need to be investigated to further understand how capital-income breeding strategies shape male mating strategies.";"Fasting; Sexual selection; Mating system; Male-male competition; Intrasexual selection; Lekking; Polygyny; Oxidative stress";2019;"JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY";"Biology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Variability in lek attendance could confound interpretation of male reproductive effort and complicate the use of lek counts as an index to monitor abundance. We assessed the daily probability of male Sage Grouse Centrocercus urophasianus lek attendance and explored implications of attendance on lek counts. We fitted 145 males with global positioning system (GPS) transmitters over 4 years in Carbon County, Wyoming. We evaluated influences of lek size and topography, date, weather, and bird characteristics such as age on daily morning lek attendance. The daily probability of attendance ranged considerably each year, from 0.120 (x over bar , 95% CI 0.051-0.259) in 2012 to 0.917 (95% CI 0.844-0.957) in 2013 with peak attendance dates ranging from 8 April (2012) to 11 May (2011). Attendance decreased with increasing precipitation on the observation day. Only 44-79% of lek counts occurred on days without precipitation and with high attendance (i.e. within 0.1 probability of peak predicted attendance). Although lek counts and population abundance, predicted using attendance rates, followed a similar trend, the relationship was not significantly correlated. We provide empirical evidence supporting current lek-count protocols: managers should avoid counting leks on days with precipitation because attendance is reduced.

Food limitations have been hypothesized to exacerbate the boom and bust cycle exhibited by bobwhites, with supplemental feeding advocated as a way to mitigate this annual variability in demographics. A new technique (i.e., broadcast feeding) has exhibited positive effects on the seasonal survival of bobwhites. To ensure the safe adoption of any management practice, replication is necessary. We employed a randomized, crossover experimental design to evaluate the effect of 3 different supplemental feed rates (full [69.1 kg/km], half [34.6 kg/km], control [no feed]) on bobwhite survival and used the known-fate data type to assess the fate of radio-marked individuals within the Rolling Plains of Texas, USA. We assessed temporal (biological vs. calendar season) and treatment-level (feed vs. control) effects on survival. Our top temporal model included an interaction between year and calendar season as the most parsimonious model. Survival was lowest during winter. The most parsimonious treatment-level model included an interaction between feed and winter, plus the additive effect of snow depth. The application of the full and half feed treatments had positive effects on survival during winter compared to control units in both years, across all pastures. Our data indicated there was no difference between the full and half feed rates. Snow accumulation had a negative effect on survival in both years. Broadcast feeding improved winter survival rates and subsequently, the number of females available entering the breeding season. Broadcast feeding serves as an additional management tool for wildlife managers within a strategic management program to benefit bobwhite survival during periods of physiological stress. We recommend the continued use of this management technique in regions where similar range and weather conditions exist to further evaluate its effectiveness.

Increased wildfire activity constitutes a primary threat to the species in western portions of their range, with documented declines in wildfire-affected populations. Following a 187,000-ha wildfire in southeastern Oregon and northern Nevada, USA, we used global positioning system (GPS) telemetry to monitor nest initiation, nest survival, nesting habitat, and adult survival of female sage-grouse during 2013 and 2014. We used known-fate models in Program MARK to estimate daily nest survival and monthly adult survival in relation to temporal patterns, physiological characteristics of females, and habitat and land-cover characteristics. We assessed habitat characteristics using geographic information system (GIS)-derived measures of post-fire habitat condition and land cover. Nest initiation rate following the fire was comparable to that observed in unaltered habitat. We observed nesting rates of 90% and 100% during 2013 and 2014, respectively, and renesting rates of 23% and 57% during the same years. Daily nest survival was consistently low in comparison to rates observed in concurrent studies in the region, for first nests during both years, and for second nests during 2013, but survival markedly increased for second nests during 2014. Sage-grouse generally did not leave the fire perimeter to nest, with 64% and 73% of nests located in the fire boundary during 2013 and 2014, respectively. Approximately 27% of nests were located in burned habitat during 2013, and 20% of nests in 2014 were located in burned habitat. Adult survival varied by month, and although patterns of monthly survival were similar between years, monthly survival rates were significantly reduced from the beginning of the study through the end of the first post-fire growing season. Our results indicate that sage-grouse continue to use fire-affected habitat in the years immediately following wildfire and sage-grouse experienced lower nest survival and adult female survival than other populations during the same period.

Prescribed fire is often applied while female wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) are reproductively active and may immediately affect habitat availability and demographic outcomes. We identified covariates affecting selection of areas used by nesting and brooding females and determined if these covariates influenced nest and brood survival in a longleaf pine ecosystem. We captured 63 female wild turkeys and measured vegetation and landscape characteristics surrounding nests, brood roosts, and daytime use sites. We used conditional logistic regression to determine which vegetation and landscape-scale characteristics influenced nest, brood roost, or daytime use sites. We generated Cox proportional hazard models at multiple spatial scales to determine if selection influenced nest and brood survival. Females selected nest sites with greater visual obstruction and increased ground cover, and also nested closer to roads. We observed relevant differences in vegetation and landscape variables associated with where females chose to roost broods compared to sites chosen for foraging or loafing. Females roosted broods at sites with increased ground cover and decreased visual obstruction, and daytime use by broods was most related to increases in ground cover. Time-since-fire was an informative covariate for brood site selection but not for nest site selection. Females selected brood roost sites in stands not recently burned (3-6 yr post-fire), and selected daytime use sites in stands burned the current year (0 yr post-fire) and 2 years post-fire. We failed to observe links between selection of vegetation and landscape covariates and probability of nest or brood survival. Notably, our results suggest short (i.e., 1-2 yr) fire return intervals do not provide vegetation communities selected by females to roost broods. Conversely, stands burned within the current year were important for daytime use by broods. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the importance of maintaining diverse fire return intervals to ensure availability of vegetation conditions necessary for nesting and brooding.

Understanding factors influencing nest-site selection and nest survival are important for conservation and management of lesser prairie-chicken populations. However, >75% of the extant population is in the northern extent of the range where data on breeding season ecology are lacking. We tested factors influencing fine-scale and regional nest-site selection and nest survival across the northern portion of the lesser prairie-chicken range. We trapped and affixed satellite global positioning system and very high frequency transmitters to female lesser prairie-chickens (n = 307) in south-central and western Kansas and eastern Colorado, USA. We located and monitored 257 lesser prairie-chicken nests from 2013 to 2016. We evaluated nest-site selection and nest survival in comparison to vegetation composition and structure. Overall, nest-site selection in relation to vegetation characteristics was similar across our study area. Lesser prairie-chickens selected nest microsites with 75% visual obstruction 2.0-3.5 dm tall and 95.7% of all nests were in habitat with >= 1 dm and <= 4 dm visual obstruction. Nests were located in areas with 6-8% bare ground, on average, avoiding areas with greater percent cover of bare ground. The type of vegetation present was less important than cover of adequate height. Nest survival was maximized when 75% visual obstruction was 2.0-4.0 dm. Nest survival did not vary spatially or among years and generally increased as intensity of drought decreased throughout the study although not significantly. To provide nesting cover considering yearly variation in drought conditions, it is important to maintain residual cover by managing for structural heterogeneity of vegetation. Managing for structural heterogeneity could be accomplished by maintaining or strategically applying practices of the Conservation Reserve Program, using appropriate fire and grazing disturbances in native working grasslands, and establishing site-specific monitoring of vegetation composition and structure.

However, recent analyses indicate that direct loss of grassland has slowed while lesser prairie-chicken populations continue to decline, suggesting that remaining grasslands potentially suffer from degradation by various land uses (e.g., increased anthropogenic disturbance). Understanding the spatial ecology of lesser prairie-chickens relative to anthropogenic structures is important for conservation planning, habitat management, and infrastructure mitigation. We investigated effects of proximity to anthropogenic structures on home range and nest placement (second-order selection) and within home range space use (third-order selection) of radio-marked lesser prairie-chickens (n = 285) at 2 scales of selection using resource utilization functions and resource selection functions. We collected data from birds marked in the Mixed-Grass Prairie and Short-Grass Prairie ecoregions of Kansas, USA, from 15 March 2013 to 14 March 2016. Home range placement did not vary by region or season, and lesser prairie-chickens placed home ranges farther from powerlines and roads than would be expected at random. As distance increased from 0 to 3 km away from roads and powerlines, the relative probability of home range placement increased 1.66 and 1.54 times, respectively. Distance to powerline was the single most consistent variable negatively affecting nest placement. As the distance from powerline increased from 0 to 3 km, the relative probability of nest placement increased 2.19 times. Distance to oil well did not influence placement of home ranges or nests. When pooled across regions, lesser prairie-chickens exhibited behavioral avoidance of powerlines, roads, and oil wells within their home range. Lesser prairie-chickens, on average, used space at greater intensities within their home range farther from wells, powerlines, and roads than available. Across breeding season phases, we found no evidence of increased behavioral avoidance of anthropogenic structures during the nesting or brooding phases compared to the lekking or post-breeding phases. Within home range space use during the brooding phase was not related to powerlines, wells, or roads. Our results indicate that avoidance of anthropogenic structures may result in functional habitat loss and continued fragmentation of remaining grassland habitat. Reduction or elimination of anthropogenic development in quality lesser prairie-chicken habitat and concentrating new development in already altered areas that are avoided by lesser prairie-chickens and no longer considered available habitat may reduce continued habitat degradation throughout the species' range and aid in population persistence.

This study reveals the neuroendocrine regulatory mechanisms that govern the reproductive activities and egg-laying performances of Hungarian White geese. The results indicated that increasing the daily photoperiod from a short 8 h period to either 11 h or 14 h initiated reproduction. Egg-laying rates increased faster in the 14 h group, peaking (48.2%) on day 33 as compared to the peak (52.67%) reached on day 53 in the 11 h group. Changes to the plasma estradiol and progesterone concentrations produced similar patterns in the two groups. In the hypothalamus, OPN5, Dio2, c-Fos, and GnRH-I expression levels showed similar sequential increases and decreases. Changes in GnIH and VIP expression levels were the opposite to those of GnRH-I, but the levels peaked earlier under the 14 h photoperiod conditions. Pituitary LH beta and FSH beta expression levels increased at slower rates but remained significantly higher in the 11 h group than in the 14 h group. However, pituitary PRL expression increased considerably earlier and was higher in 14 h geese than in 11 h geese, which was opposite to the observed egg-laying rate patterns. An increase from a short to a relatively long photoperiod (11 h) regulated the neuroendocrine system and led to reproductive activities being sustained for a longer period, which resulted in high egg-laying performances.

To enhance habitat for fish and wildlife and increase resiliency in these critical areas, land managers in the interior western United States increasingly use alternative grazing strategies, beaver management, or beaver dam surrogates as low-effort, low-expense restoration approaches. In this study we used historical archives of satellite and aerial imagery spanning three decades to characterize riparian vegetation productivity and document beaver dam occurrences, then evaluated vegetation productivity relative to land management associated with livestock grazing and beaver dam densities while accounting for climate and wildfire. After controlling for stream characteristics such as stream size, elevation, and stream slope, we demonstrate a positive response of riparian area vegetation to conservation-oriented grazing approaches and livestock exclosures, extensive beaver dam development, increased precipitation, and lack of wildfire. We show that livestock management which emphasizes riparian recovery objectives can be an important precursor to beaver activity and describe 11-39% increases in floodplain vegetation productivity where conservation-oriented grazing approaches or livestock exclosures and high beaver activity occur together on low-gradient sites. Land management decisions can therefore potentially confer resiliency to riparian areas under changing and variable climate conditions-the increased vegetation productivity resulting from conservation-oriented grazing or exclosures and high amounts of beaver activity at our sites is the equivalent to moving conventionally-grazed, low-gradient sites without beaver up at least 250 m in elevation or increasing water year precipitation by at least 250 mm.";NA;2018;"PLOS ONE";"Multidisciplinary Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Wild birds, particularly waterfowl (Anseriformes), are known reservoirs for low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses (AIV) and recent studies have shown their potential in the spread of highly pathogenic forms of virus. East Asia remains an epicenter for the emergence of novel strains of AIV, however, information on movement ecology of waterfowl, and subsequently a clearer understanding of disease transmission risks in this region has been greatly lacking. To address this, we marked two species of wild waterfowl, northern pintail (Anas acuta) and Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope), with satellite transmitters on their wintering grounds in Hong Kong, China to study the northward spring migration in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway in relation to disease transmission factors. Northern pintail were found to initiate migration 42 days earlier, travel 2,150 km farther, and perform 4.4 more stopovers than Eurasian wigeon. We found both species used similar stopover locations including areas along the Yangtze River near Shanghai, Bohai Bay and Korea Bay in rapidly developing regions of the Yellow Sea, and the Sea of Okhotsk where the species appeared to funnel through a migratory bottleneck. Both species appeared to exhibit strong habitat selection for rice paddies during migration stopovers, a habitat preference which has the potential to influence risks of AIV outbreaks as rapid land use and land cover changes occur throughout China. Both species had greatest association with H5N1 outbreaks during the early stages of migration when they were at lower latitudes. While Eurasian wigeon were not associated with outbreaks after the mean date of wintering ground departures, northern pintail were associated with outbreaks until the majority of individuals departed from the Yellow Sea, a migratory stopover location. Our results show species-level differences in migration timing and behavior for these common and widespread species, demonstrating the need to consider their unique temporal and spatial movement ecology when incorporating wild birds into AIV risk modeling and management.";"migration; stopover; avian influenza virus; H5N1; waterfowl; East Asian-Australasian Flyway";2018;"FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION";"Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We tested whether restoring heather habitat on a grouse moor in southwest Scotland, where heather was previously in decline, improved Red Grouse density, productivity, and survival. We analyzed spatial and temporal relationships between Red Grouse demographic rates, estimated from counts, and habitat variables measured from ground and aerial vegetation surveys. Reductions in sheep Ovis aries grazing and other heather restoration measures (i.e. burning and cutting, and in some areas reseeding of heather following herbicide treatment to reduce grass dominance) increased total heather cover by 10% and the area of heather-dominated vegetation by 30% within six years. Prebreeding, and for aerial surveys also postbreeding, densities of Red Grouse were highest in areas with more heather cover (range: 0-92%), and prebreeding densities increased more where heather recovery was greatest. However, we found no relationship between heather cover and Red Grouse productivity or survival rates, the latter also when rates were estimated from radio-tagged individuals. Changes in heather cover were not associated with changes in postbreeding densities or survival of Red Grouse, although they were positively related to change in productivity for aerial surveys. Overall, management for Red Grouse had a larger effect on density and productivity than reductions in sheep grazing. This is the first study examining Red Grouse responses in relation to changes in heather cover within the same site, in contrast to previous between-moor comparisons, where other factors may have contributed to variation in Red Grouse demography.

Until now, no individual taxa have been suggested as distinc and characteristic new morphaspecies representing this change. Here we show that the domestic broiler chicken is one such potential marker. Human-directed changes in breeding, diet and farming practices demonstrate at least a doubling in body size from the late medieval period to the present in domesticated chickens, and an up to fivefold increase in body mass since the mid-twentieth century. Moreover, the skeletal morphology, pathology, bone geochemistry and genetics of modern broilers are demonstrably different to those of their. ancestors. Physical and numerical changes to chickens in the second half of the twentieth century, i.e. during the putative Anthropocene Epoch, have been the most dramatic, with large increases in individual bird growth rate and population sizes. Broiler chickens, now unable to survive without human intervention, have a combined mass exceeding that of all other birds on Earth; this novel morphotype symbolizes the unprecedented human reconfiguration of the Earth's biosphere.";"biosphere; chicken; Anthropocene; agriculture; evolution";2018;"ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE";"Multidisciplinary Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Generally this behaviour is considered consistent throughout the whole nesting cycle but there can be exceptions in some species. We found two switches in egg covering during nesting in grey partridge: the first between two early laying phases, the second between later laying and incubation. The clutch containing only the first egg remained uncovered, larger clutches were covered with dry vegetation in the laying period, but the eggs remained uncovered during incubation breaks. There was a strong consistency of this behaviour among females. From four tested factors, only nesting period significantly affected egg covering. We assume that the fast uncovered egg may serve as a bait for predators to test nest-site safety whereas the motion in the course of egg covering during short incubation breaks may increase predator attraction.";"birds; nesting phase; nest depredation; nest survival; antipredator tactic; testing egg";2018;"FOLIA ZOOLOGICA";"Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Only those that exert strong (delayed) regulation of their prey can be. Inferring predator-prey coupling from time series therefore requires contrasting models with top-down versus bottom-up predator-prey dynamics. We study here the joint dynamics of population densities of the Icelandic gyrfalcon Falco rusticolus, and its prey, the rock ptarmigan Lagopus muta. The dynamics of both species are likely not only linked to each other but also to stochastic weather variables acting as confounding factors. We infer the degree of coupling between populations, as well as forcing by abiotic variables, using multivariate autoregressive models MAR(p), with p = 1 and 2 time lags. MAR(2) models, allowing for species to cycle independently from each other, further suggest alternative scenarios where a cyclic prey influences its predator but not the other way around (i.e., bottom-up scenarios). The classical MAR(1) model predicts that the time series exhibit predator-prey feedback (i.e., reciprocal dynamic influence between prey and predator), and that weather effects are weak and only affecting the gyrfalcon population. Bottom-up MAR(2) models produced a better fit but less realistic cross-correlation patterns. Simulations of MAR(1) and MAR(2) models further demonstrate that the top-down MAR(1) models are more likely to be misidentified as bottom-up dynamics than vice versa. We therefore conclude that predator-prey feedback in the gyrfalcon-ptarmigan system is likely the main cause of observed oscillations, though bottom-up dynamics cannot yet be excluded with certainty. Overall, we showed how to make more out of ecological time series by using simulations to gauge the quality of model identification, and paved the way for more mechanistic modeling of this system by narrowing the set of important biotic and abiotic drivers.";"consumer-resource; Falco rusticolus; Lagopus muta; MAR; population cycles; VAR";2018;"ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION";"Ecology; Evolutionary Biology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Greater and Gunnison sage-grouse, Centrocercus urophasianus and C. minimus, are adapted to patterns of resource intermittence and rely on stable adult survival supplemented by occasional recruitment pulses when climatic conditions are favorable. Predictions of intensifying water scarcity raise concerns over new demographic bottlenecks impacting sage-grouse populations in drought-sensitive landscapes. We estimate biome-wide mesic resource productivity from 1984 to 2016 using remote sensing to identify patterns of food availability influencing selective pressures on sage-grouse. We linked productivity to abiotic factors to examine effects of seasonal drought across time, space, and land tenure, with findings partitioned along gradients of ecosystem water balance within Great Basin, Rocky Mountains and Great Plains regions. Precipitation was the driver of mesic resource abundance explaining >= 70% of variance in drought-limited vegetative productivity. Spatiotemporal shifts in mesic abundance were apparent given biome-wide climatic trends that reduced precipitation below three-quarters of normal in 20% of years. Drought sensitivity structured grouse populations wherein landscapes with the greatest uncertainty in mesic abundance and distribution supported the fewest grouse. Privately owned lands encompassed 40% of sage-grouse range, but contained a disproportional 68% of mesic resources. Regional drought sensitivity identified herein acted as ecological minimums to influence differences in landscape carrying capacity across sage-grouse range. Our model depictions likely reflect a new normal in water scarcity that could compound impacts of demographic bottlenecks in Great Basin and Great Plains. We conclude that long-term population maintenance depends on a diversity of drought resistant mesic resources that offset climate driven variability in vegetative productivity.

Several factors can be involved but heat stress is one of most important environmental factor influencing a wide range of thickens performances including reduced feed intake which, in turn, affects growth rate, body weight, meat quality, egg quality, egg production, semen quality and fertility; these negative influences result in great economic losses. Heat stress associated food safety issues have gained special importance due to public awareness and an abundance of available scientific information. Environmental modifications (early heat conditioning, open sheds and cooling systems) and nutritional strategies (early feed restriction, electrolyte, vitamin and mineral balance) cannot satisfy the special needs of stressed poultry.

Wild turkeys are the only gamebird species in the contiguous United States hunted primarily during their reproductive period. Managers attempt to implement seasons that allow for hunter satisfaction while limiting effects to reproduction and ensuring sustainable populations. To minimize illegal harvest, managers often attempt to set spring hunting seasons when gobbling activity is high and females are actively incubating nests. Gobbling activity varies significantly both temporally and spatially, and relationships between gobbling activity and reproductive phenology are unclear. We used autonomous recording units and Global Positioning System transmitters to monitor gobbling activity by male eastern wild turkeys (M. g. silvestris) and evaluate fine-scale movements of male wild turkeys and nesting chronology of females on the Webb Wildlife Management Area Complex in South Carolina, USA, during 2015-2016. Based on 19,126 gobbles and movement ecology data from 99 wild turkeys (70 F, 29 M), we found no discernable pattern to support the hypothesis that gobbling activity increases with onset of incubation by females. We also observed no definable relationship between daily movements of males and gobbling activity, likely driven by the considerable daily variability in gobbling activity. We noted apparent lags in gobbling activity relative to nest initiation (onset of laying), and offer that understanding mechanisms underlying these apparent lags may be important to improving our understanding of reproductive ecology in wild turkeys. Research evaluating confounding influences of hunting activity and male mortality during the breeding season on gobbling activity and wild turkey population dynamics is warranted.

Differences in behavioral traits in relation to the phylogenetic background and productivity level in laying hens";"Different lines of laying hens have undergone a strong selection pressure for productivity traits, which has been proposed as a potential cause of undesirable side effects like behavioural disorders. One reason for such behavioral changes might be due to energy trade-offs, as high productive laying hens may conserve energy expenditure on activity in order to sustain the high level of egg production. However, beside the level of egg production, also phylogenetic origin has potential implications on differences in fearfulness, stress reactivity and sociality in layers. In this study, we compared four purebred layer lines differing in egg laying productivity and phylogenetic origin on their fearfulness and sociality prior to the start of laying. We used 77 chickens in a 2 x 2 group design, with two layer lines with white egg shell color and two lines with brown color which differed in laying performance ( similar to 200 versus similar to 300 egg / y, respectively, within colors). We measured fearfulness and sociality using five different behavioral tests (visual cliff, social approach, novel-object, mirror approach and tonic immobility). The data from the tests were analyzed using a principle component analysis revealing that our data were best explained by two components representing the dimension social behavior (PC1) and fear (PC2), respectively, which were further analyzed by a linear model (LM). The high productive lines showed a lower social motivation (lower values on PC1(social) LM: p < 0.0001) than the less productive lines and the white hens had a higher social motivation than brown hens (higher values on PC1(social), LM; p = 0.0004). Our results indicated that phylogeny and level of egg production affected the two dimensions of behavior differently with sociality but not fearfulness likely linked to the level of egg productivity. The decreased engagement in social behavior is consistent with the notion of energy trade-offs due to intense selection on egg productivity. The unintentional impacts of selection on behavior deserves further research, especially with regard to potential effects on welfare.";"Phylogeny; Domestication; Poultry; Animal welfare; Laying hens; Gallus gallus; Resource allocation";2018;"APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE";"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Behavioral Sciences; Veterinary Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We developed a population model, initially 2350 adult females, re-sampling parameters measured through fieldwork and satellite telemetry, over 1000 iterations. With current flyway-scale unregulated harvest, and without any licensed hunting in the concession, populations declined at 9.4% year(-1) (95% CI: -18.9 to 0% year(-1)); in this scenario a precautionary approach (85% probability lambda >= 1.0) to population stabilisation required releasing 3100 captive bred females year(-1) (131% of initial wild numbers). A precautionary approach to sustainable hunting of 100 females year(-1) required releasing 3600 females year(-1) (153% of initial wild numbers); but if interventions reduced flyway-scale hunting/trapping mortality by 60% or 80%, sustaining this quota required releasing 900 or 400 females year(-1), 38% and 17% of initial wild numbers, respectively. Parameter uncertainty increased precautionary numbers for release, but even with reduced precaution (50% probability lambda >= 1.0), sustainable hunting of 100 females year(-1) required annual releases of 2200 females (94% wild) without other measures, but 300 (13%) or no (0%) females under scenarios of a 60% or 80% reduction in flyway-scale hunting/trapping.

Neither the population sizes nor biomasses of native and alien species differed, on average, in either census, but alien species biomass is higher than native species biomass for a given population size. Species richness underestimates the potential effects of alien bird species in Britain, which have disproportionately high overall biomass and population energy use. The main driver of these effects is the ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), which comprised 74-81% of alien biomass, yet the breeding population of this species is still only a small fraction of the estimated 35 million birds released in the UK in autumn.

While all 21 species were predicted to experience at least a 2 degrees C increase in mean annual temperature, 12 to experience a moderate or greater fluctuation in rainfall and 16 to experience rising seas, the most vulnerable megapodes are intrinsically rare and range restricted. Species that employ microbial decomposition for incubation may have an adaptive advantage over those that do not and may be more resilient to climate change. The moderate microclimate necessary for mound incubation, however, may in some areas be threatened by anthropogenic habitat loss exacerbated by warmer and seasonally drier conditions.

Captive red legged partridges (Alectoris rufa; n = 11-13 pairs per treatment) were fed wheat treated with 0%, 20% or 100% of the fiutriafol application rate during 25 days in late winter. We studied treatment effects on the reproductive performance, carotenoid-based coloration and cellular immune responsiveness of adult partridges, and their relationship with changes in oxidative stress biomarkers and plasma biochemistry. We also studied the effect of parental exposure on egg antioxidant content and on the survival, growth and cellular immune response of offspring. Exposed partridges experienced physiological effects (reduced levels of cholesterol and triglycerides), phenotypical effects (a reduction in the carotenoid-based pigmentation of their eye rings), and most importantly, severe adverse effects on reproduction: a reduced clutch size and fertile egg ratio, and an overall offspring production reduced by more than 50%. No effects on body condition or cellular immune response of either exposed adult or their surviving offspring were observed. These results, together with previous data on field exposure in wild partridges, demonstrate that seed treatment with flutriafol represents a risk for granivorous birds; they also highlight a need to improve the current regulation system used for foreseeing and preventing negative impacts of Plant Protection Products on wildlife.

For this study, we test an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guideline 223 for assessing the acute toxic potential of pesticides in birds by exposing three avian species to the drug. Exposed Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica) and Muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata) demonstrated clinical signs and pathology similar to those previously reported in vultures viz. hyperuricemia, depression, death, visceral gout and nephrosis. However, exposed domestic pigeons (Columba livia domestica) were insensitive. Following a pharmacokinetic analysis, the drug was well absorbed and distributed in the pigeons with a half-life below 6 h. A toxicokinetic evaluation in quails showed poisoning was due to metabolic constraint, with a half-life and mean residence time above 6 h and 8 h respectively resulting in death. Toxicity seen in the ducks was however not related to metabolic constraint but hyperuricemia as metabolism was rapid [half-life (1-2 h) and mean residence time (2-3 h)] irrespective of survival or death. Despite succumbing to diclofenac, the established oral median lethal dose (LD50) of 405.42 mg/kg and 189.92 mg/kg in Japanese quails and Muscovy ducks respectively from this study were substantially higher than those reported for Gyps vultures (0.098 mg/kg) which is as a result of the rapid elimination of the drug from the body in the former species. More importantly, it suggests that these species are not suitable as surrogates for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug toxicity testing and that the toxicity of diclofenac in vultures is idiosyncratic most likely as a result of species specific metabolism.";"Gyps vultures; Diclofenac; LD50; Pharmacokinetics; Acute toxicity";2018;"ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY";"Environmental Sciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Toxicology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We assessed whether (i) annual duck harvest in these two countries correlated with variation in Finnish reproductive output or adult population size during 1990-2016 and (ii) variation in reproductive output of Finnish ducks was reflected in the juvenile ratios of birds harvested in Finland (2005-2007, 2014-2016) or Denmark (1990-2016). We hypothesised that variation in Finnish reproductive output would positively affect the size and juvenile ratio of the harvest, and that this effect would be stronger closer to the breeding grounds. Our data showed that the annual harvest of goldeneye in Finland was positively correlated with reproductive output, a desirable basis for applying sustainable management to this species. Teal and wigeon have much longer, more complex flyways, and their harvest did not mirror the annual production of young, although the wigeon harvest in Denmark increased with increasing juvenile ratio there. For these populations, we need to better define population units if we are to be able to assess harvest sustainability.

We conducted a study with artificial nests and wildlife cameras (n=104) in agricultural landscapes during 2015-2016 in South Finland. Our trials formed a 400-m wide gradient from forest to field. The aim of our study was to monitor nest survival and nest predators in a spatial and temporal scale. We tested the effect of distance to the forest and nest visibility to nest predation. During an 8-day period, 39.4% of the artificial nests were predated. Fifty percent of the predators were birds, 40% mammals, and 10% remained unknown. The three dominant predators of our artificial nests were the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) with 11 nests and the hooded crow (Corvus corone cornix) and the magpie (Pica pica) with 10 depredated nests each. Our analysis indicates that avian predators preyed upon nests in open fields further away from the forest edge, whereas mammalian predation concentrated closer to the forest edge.

Solutions are usually available to reduce the impacts of predation if the predator is non-native or not legally protected (e.g. predator control or exclusion). However, when the predator is protected by law (e.g. raptors) potential solutions are limited. If predator and prey are both species of conservation concern this can bring the conservation of these species into conflict. Diversionary feeding (DF) is a potential solution, whereby predators are provided with food to reduce their motivation to hunt. The efficacy of DF has rarely been tested thus, in this paper, we test the efficacy of DF to reduce predation by kestrels, Falco tinninculus, a protected and declining raptor, on little tern chicks, Sternula albifrons, a protected seabird, within an internationally important colony in eastern England. We used a 17-year dataset of annual estimates of little tern productivity and counts of kestrel predation events to compare years with and without DF (DF = 6 years). During a four-year period of more intensive monitoring efforts, where we employed DF at focal kestrel nests in alternate years, we quantified the rates of kestrel predation at the colony and prey provisioning rates at kestrel nests. Predation rates were 47% lower and productivity of little terns doubled in years when kestrels were fed. Intensive monitoring showed that predation rates by kestrels at the colony were 88% lower in the two years when kestrels were fed. Provisioning rates of all wild prey and little tern prey, was 3.4 and 6.2 times lower in DF years and the likelihood of little tern chicks being provisioned at nests was lower when alternative wild prey were provisioned. DF is an effective tool to reduce predation and increase productivity of little tern colonies threatened by kestrel predation. The magnitude of these effects on lithe tern productivity was sufficient to promote population increases. Raptor conservation has resulted in increasing populations of many species and it is expected that predator-prey conflicts are likely to increase. DF could be an important tool to manage these conservation issues, but further tests of the efficacy in different predator-prey systems will be needed.";"Little tern; Sternula albifrons; Kestrel; Falco tinnuculus; Alternative prey; Conservation conflict";2018;"JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION";"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

A severe and prolonged drought from 2009 to 2013 resulted in further declines in population numbers and despite improved environmental and habitat conditions since 2013, populations of lesser prairie chickens have shown little improvement. To investigate whether breeding season survival of lesser prairie-chickens in eastern New Mexico could be driving this response, we developed the following objectives: 1) estimate male and female breeding-season survival; 2) determine whether male and female survival varies temporally among lekking, nesting, and brood-rearing periods; and 3) determine cause-specific mortality during the breeding season. We captured and radiocollared 76 lesser prairie-chickens (50 male, 26 female) during spring of 2014 and 2015 and estimated their survival throughout the breeding season (15 March-31 August). Male survival was nearly double that of females in both years (0.79-0.81 and 0.38-0.45, respectively). Males had similar survival across all periods (lekking, postlekking, late summer: 0.89-0.95). Females had the greatest period-specific survival during lekking and brood rearing (0.87 +/- 0.08 and 0.85 +/- 0.10, respectively) relative to the nesting period (0.58 +/- 0.11). Mammalian predation was the primary cause of mortality in both years. Our results indicate that in New Mexico 1) lesser prairie-chicken breeding season survival was consistent with geographically similar studies, 2) females have lower survival during the nesting period, and 3) female lesser prairie-chicken survival was lower than male survival regardless of time period.

Recent interest in reestablishing the species west of the Continental Divide has identified information gaps related to the potential success of a restoration effort. Elsewhere, sharp-tailed grouse are widespread and exhibit plasticity in habitat use, suggesting a high potential for successful reintroduction. Using life history information from the published literature, we conducted a population viability analysis to assess the potential viability of a reintroduced population of sharp-tailed grouse in western Montana and to evaluate what management scenarios, with regard to both translocation protocols and habitat management, would be necessary to produce a viable population. Results of the population viability analysis indicated that a population parameterized with mean reported demographic rates and related environmental variation would not be viable and suggest a potential downward bias in demographic estimates in the published literature. Based on our simulation results, improvements in both fecundity and annual survival resulting from improvements in nesting and winter habitat would be necessary to produce a viable population of sharp-tailed grouse in western Montana. The minimum amount of habitat required to support a viable population of 280 individuals was 1,867-5,600 ha, assuming habitat is sufficient to support an average density of 5-15 grouse per km(2). We provide a review of demographic and reintroduction information for sharp-tailed grouse and recommendations regarding reintroduction approaches based on our population viability analysis results that should increase the relative success of restoration efforts in western Montana and elsewhere.

Using a stratified random survey design, we allocated sample plots by elevation and land cover with a preference for wetland cover types used by shorebirds, a group of particular interest to land managers. We surveyed birds during 10-min counts at 792 points across 52, 5 km x 5 km sample plots distributed from south of the Naknek River (58.70 degrees N,157.00 degrees W) to north of Port Moller (56.00 degrees N,160.52 degrees W). We detected 95 bird species including 19 species of shorebirds and 34 species (36% of total) considered at the time to be of conservation concern for the land managers in the region. The most numerous shorebirds on point counts were dunlin Calidris alpina, short-billed dowitcher Limnodromus griseus, and Wilson's snipe Gallinago delicata. We found the breeding-season endemic marbled godwit Limosa fedoa beringiae at 20 plots within a 3,000-km(2) area from north of Ugashik Bay to just north of Port Heiden and east to the headwaters of the Dog Salmon and Ugashik rivers. The most abundant passerines on point counts were American tree sparrow Spizelloides arborea, Lapland longspur Cakarius lapponicus, and savannah sparrow Passerculus sandwichensis. Sandhill crane Antigone canadensis, glaucous-winged gull Larus glaucescens, and greater scaup Aythya marila were also relatively abundant. We categorized habitat associations for 30 common species and found that lowland herbaceous vegetation supported wetland-focused species including sandhill crane, marbled godwit, short-billed dowitcher, and dunlin; whereas, dwarf shrub-ericaceous vegetation supported tundra-associated species such as willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus, rock sandpiper Calidris ptilocnemis, and American pipit Anthus rubescens. Tall shrub vegetation was important to several species of warblers and sparrows, as well as one species of shorebird (greater yellowlegs Tringa melanoleuca).

Even though many studies have focused on the mechanisms of unevenly distributed fauna and flora, there remains much to learn about the evolutionary drivers behind biodiversity hotspots. In the Tibetan Plateau and Hengduan Mountains, a biodiversity hotspot in the Palearctic realm, alpine uplift cannot be the driver for recent speciation (< two million years ago), researchers broadly refer to climatic oscillations driven biodiversity, however, the specific individual roles of glaciation and inter-glaciation periods in promoting biodiversity is unclear. The current study focuses on investigating whether recent speciation between two close-related avian species (White eared pheasant, Crossoptilon crossoptilon and Tibetan eared pheasant, C. harmani) was driven by glaciation-based isolation or by dispersal during inter-glaciation. To answer this question, we combined Sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing technology to estimate population structure, phylogeny, divergence time, demographic history and potential historical distributions for C. crossoptilon and C. harmani, which are endemic to China. We found that the divergence time between these two species and within C. crossoptilon are both during glaciation periods. During glaciation periods, both C. harmani and C. crossoptilon experienced isolated distributions and extreme bottlenecks. The results of this study suggest that glaciation-based isolation contributed to recent speciation in the Tibetan Plateau and Hengduan Mountains, and sheds light on our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms that contributed to the formation of Palearctic alpine biodiversity hotspots and unevenly distributed species richness pattern.";"Speciation; Glaciation-based isolation; Biodiversity hotspots; Tibetan plateau; Hengduan mountains; Crossoptilon";2018;"MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION";"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), a small amphiphilic molecule used as penetrating cryoprotectant for biological cells, has been recognized as an adequate alternative for cryopreservation of sperm from several species. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of different concentrations of DMSO as cryoprotectant for Indian red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus murghi) sperm. Semen was collected from Indian red jungle fowl cocks, pooled and divided into five aliquots. Different concentrations of DMSO (0%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10%) were compared. Diluted semen was cooled from 37 degrees C to 4 degrees C (-0.275 degrees C min(-1)) , 20% glycerol added to control and equilibrated for 10 min. After equilibration, semen was filled in 0.5 mL French straws, kept over liquid nitrogen vapors for 10 min and plunged into liquid nitrogen. Semen samples were thawed at 37 degrees C for 30 s. Cryo-survival of Indian red jungle fowl sperm was affected by cryopreservation stages and different concentrations of cryoprotectant used. Highest sperm motility (85.0 +/- 2.9; 80.0 +/- 3.5; 713 +/- 4.3; 60.0 +/- 1.3), plasma membrane integrity (79.5 +/- 3.8; 75.3 +/- 2.4; 72.8 +/- 3.3; 60.3 +/- 2.8), viability (80.8 +/- 4.6; 75.5 +/- 2.9; 71.0 +/- 7.6; 58.8 +/- 1.3) and acrosomal integrity (763 +/- 2.4; 72.0 +/- 6.0; 62.5 +/- 4.3; 55.0 +/- 3.2) were recorded in a diluent having 8% DMSO at post-dilution, cooling, equilibration and freeze-thawing. Highest fertility results were obtained after artificial insemination with 8% DMSO compared to 20% glycerol (73.0 +/- 4.4 vs 53.1 +/- 4.3, P <0.05).

Prey species can optimize feeding behavior and escape from predators based on mobility conditioned by body proportions. With age, mobility capacity increases and individuals are more efficient in finding resources and safety (e.g., food and refuge). Birds' mobility is driven by the dimensions, of the head and torso, as well as the extremities and flight feathers. To assess the relationship between body traits and to understand how body proportions are organized in wild Red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa), we used biometric data from nearly 14,000 individuals, obtained during a long-term study (1988-2011) on a wild population.ResultsWe used GLMs and regressions to model the relationship between body mass and the size of body parts. We found that wing length was the morphological part best explained by other body trait measures. Wing length models were better predictors in juveniles than in adults and in females than in males. Wing length and feather length, mass and total length are the most strongly related parts; mass and wing length, total length and feather length are moderately related. The association between mass and wing length is intermediated by feather length and total length.ConclusionsSocial inclusion, feeding and predator evasion may be affected by body structure intermediated by mobility and health. Our results suggest that proportions of the body, extremities and flight feathers drive mobility which is intimately associated with ecology, biological efficiency, health and physical optimization. Our findings showed that wing size was strongly allied to other body part measurements, enhancing the importance of body structure conformation for flight. Our study highlights the scaled relationship of body structure among age-sex classes and its relevance to social cohesion, flock movement and the balance between predation and starvation.";"Body proportions; Body relations; Partridge mobility; Run-fly; Size balance; Walk-run";2018;"BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY";"Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The objective of the present study was to investigate the 5-HIT role in fear in birds at the very early stages of post-hatching life. Using an avoidance test with an elevated balance beam, which was based on depth perception and the respective fear of heights, we assessed fear-related avoidance behaviors of newly hatched chicks of the three functional 5-HIT genotypes W/W, W/D and D/D. Newly hatched chicks of the genotype D/D, which was linked to high 5-HIT expression, showed less intensive avoidance responses as measured by decreased latency to jump than W/W and W/D chicks. Further, significantly fewer D/D hens than W/W hens showed fear-like behavior that resembled a freezing response. Furthermore, in an arousal test the arousal reaction of the chicks in response to an acute short-term visual social deprivation in the home compartment was assessed 5 weeks after hatching, which also revealed that D/D chicks exhibited decreased arousal reaction, compared to W/W chicks. Thus, the results indicate that fear responses differ in D/D chicks in the early post-hatching periods, possibly due to the different expression of 5-HIT respectively 5-HT levels in this strain.";"serotonin transporter; 5-HTT; 5-HTT polymorphism; fear; early post-hatching periods; Gallus gallus";2018;"FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE";"Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

However, it is not clear whether an individual's cognitive performance is flexible and the result of their current social rank, modulated by social interactions (social state dependent hypothesis), or if it is determined prior to the formation of the social hierarchy and indeed influences an individual's rank (prior attributes hypothesis). We separated these two hypotheses by measuring learning performance of male pheasants, Phasianus colchicus, on a spatial discrimination task as chicks and again as adults. We inferred adult male social rank from observing agonistic interactions while housed in captive multi-male multi-female groups. Learning performance of adult males was assayed after social rank had been standardised; by housing single males with two or four females. We predicted that if cognitive abilities determine social rank formation we would observe: consistency between chick and adult performances on the cognitive task and chick performance would predict adult social rank. We found that learning performances were consistent from chicks to adults for task accuracy, but not for speed of learning and chick learning performances were not related to adult social rank. Therefore, we could not support the prior attributes hypothesis of cognitive abilities aiding social rank formation. Instead, we found that individual differences in learning performances of adults were predicted by the number of females a male was housed with; males housed with four females had higher levels of learning performance than males housed with two females; and their most recent recording of captive social rank, even though learning performance was assayed while males were in a standardized, non-competitive environment. This does not support the hypothesis that direct social pressures are causing the inter-individual variation in learning performances that we observe. Instead, our results suggest that there may be carry-over effects of aggressive social interactions on learning performance. Consequently, whether early life spatial learning performances influence social rank is unclear but these performances are modulated by the current social environment and a male's most recent social rank.";"Animal cognition; Individual differences; Social rank; Cognitive performance; Prior attributes; Social environment; Social state dependent; Spatial learning";2018;"PEERJ";"Multidisciplinary Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Hatchery waste is readily and commonly available as an animal protein source. It is the left-over from the processes of poultry hatchery, such as shell of hatched eggs, infertile eggs, dead embryos, dead chicks and culled chicks. This trial was conducted to determine the replacement value of hatchery waste meal as an alternative animal protein source for blood meal in diets of laying Japanese quail. One hundred and forty-four mature quails were allocated to three dietary treatments with three replicates of 16 quails each. Treatment (A) contained blood meal (BM), while treatments (B) and (C) contained whole hatchery waste meal (WHWM) and shell-less hatchery waste meal (SHWM), respectively. The trial lasted eight weeks. Average feed intake for treatments A, B and C were 19.7, 18.5 and 17.5 g per day/bird, respectively. Treatment B produced the highest weight gains (37.0 g per week/bird) and treatment A had the least (6.5 g per week/bird). Egg production and qualities differed among the three treatments; percentage hen day production of treatment B, A and C were 71.4, 54.6, 52.6, respectively. Egg weight was higher in treatment B (10.23 g) than treatments A and C. Haematological indices were similar among treatments.

In the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation, the Mednyi Arctic fox is listed as an endangered species. The developed model is based on data collected during 19 years of fieldwork. Annual marking of cubs in the study area allowed us to identify up to 80% of animals individually and to collect their life-history data. As a result, we identify the mortality rates of males and females of all age groups, the probabilities of breeding, litter sizes, the sex ratios of animals in different age classes, social structures, dispersal distances, and the patterns of making decisions in the selection of social partners and habitat patches. The model is spatially explicit, i.e., the heterogeneity of the habitat patches is defined in an explicit form. The model works with a time step of one year. In simulations, such demographic parameters as population dynamics, population age structure, sex ratio in different age classes, and the structure and size of families conformed to the empirical data. An analysis of the model sensitivity to the variations of mortality rates in different age groups showed that the sensitivity to the shift of cubs' mortality is much higher compared to adults of all age classes. Through increasing the cub mortality rate to 95% over a period of one to five years, we simulated the effect of otodectic mange epizootic which was observed in the real population of Mednyi Arctic fox.

Yet the prevalence and commonness of fences has contributed to their ""invisibility"" and a lack of attention in research and conservation, resulting in a scarcity of empirical data regarding their effects. Stakeholders, including scientists, conservationists, resource managers, and private landholders, have limited understanding of how fences affect individual animals, populations, or ecosystem processes. Because fences are largely unmapped and undocumented, we do not know their full spatial extent, nor do we fully comprehend the interactions of fences with wild species, whether positive or negative. To better understand and manage fence effects on wildlife and ecosystems, we advocate for an expanded effort to examine all aspects of fence ecology: the empirical investigation of the interactions between fences, wildlife, ecosystems, and societal needs. We first illustrate the global prevalence of fencing, and outline fence function and common designs. Second, we review the pros and cons of fencing relative to wildlife conservation. Lastly, we identify knowledge gaps and suggest research needs in fence ecology. We hope to inspire fellow scientists and conservationists to ""see"" and study fences as a broad-scale infrastructure that has widespread influence.

However, there are few systematic reviews of whether predation limits the population sizes of European bird species. Views on the impacts of predation are particularly polarised in the UK, probably because the UK has a globally exceptional culture of intensive, high-yield gamebird management where predator removal is the norm. In addition, most apex predators have been exterminated or much depleted in numbers, contributing to a widely held perception that the UK has high numbers of mesopredators. This has resulted in many high-quality studies of mesopredator impacts over several decades. Here we present results from a systematic review of predator trends and abundance, and assess whether predation limits the population sizes of 90 bird species in the UK. Our results confirm that the generalist predators Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) and Crows (Corvus corone and C. cornix) occur at high densities in the UK compared with other European countries. In addition, some avian and mammalian predators have increased numerically in the UK during recent decades. Despite these high and increasing densities of predators, we found little evidence that predation limits populations of pigeons, woodpeckers and passerines, whereas evidence suggests that ground-nesting seabirds, waders and gamebirds can be limited by predation. Using life-history characteristics of prey species, we found that mainly long-lived species with high adult survival and late onset of breeding were limited by predation. Single-brooded species were also more likely to be limited by predation than multi-brooded species. Predators that depredate prey species during all life stages (i.e. from nest to adult stages) limited prey numbers more than predators that depredated only specific life stages (e.g. solely during the nest phase). The Red Fox and non-native mammals (e.g. the American Mink Neovison vison) were frequently identified as numerically limiting their prey species. Our review has identified predator-prey interactions that are particularly likely to result in population declines of prey species. In the short term, traditional predator-management techniques (e.g. lethal control or fencing to reduce predation by a small number of predator species) could be used to protect these vulnerable species. However, as these techniques are costly and time-consuming, we advocate that future research should identify land-use practices and landscape configurations that would reduce predator numbers and predation rates.";"trophic cascades; intra-guild predation; landscape of fear; land-use; predator avoidance; top-down control; life-history traits; nest predation";2018;"BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS";"Biology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Populations of the Ocellated Turkey (Meleagris ocellata), a heavily hunted Yucatan endemic, appear to be declining rapidly throughout its small geographic range, despite large protected areas. We radio-tagged adult males during the breeding season in a protected, mixed-use area in Belize to describe individual and annual variation in home range size and use. Our objectives were to (1) determine the minimum reserve area necessary to sustain a population of this species, (2) evaluate use of data from related species for home range parameters in conservation plans, and (3) help design species-specific survey methods suitable for distance sampling and camera trapping. There were no differences in mean minimum convex polygon (969 ha), 95% fixed kernel (692 ha), and 50% fixed kernel (90 ha) due to breeding strategy or habitat disturbance. The core home ranges of some individuals were restricted to either intact forest or pastures. Across the entire study population, >50% of locations were in areas without closed canopy cover, which suggests that this species can use a matrix of forested and agricultural habitat. Available space-use data reveal that most fully protected areas harboring this species are unlikely to meet minimum reserve area requirements if they were to become completely isolated. In comparison to other, similarly sized galliform species, the mean home range of male Ocellated Turkeys is much larger, possibly because of the idiosyncratic requirements of different mating systems.

Conventionally, these studies are based on morphological analysis of prey remains in stomach contents, involving invasive and destructive techniques to collect samples. More recently, the number of dietary studies based on less invasive biochemical and molecular approaches has dramatically increased. However, all three methods, morphological, biochemical and molecular, have well-documented limitations for resolving taxonomy, temporal variation or biomass composition. In this study, we minimise these limitations by considering multiple techniques in combination. As a case study, we report the target prey species and diet composition of a marine predator that has been used to assess annual change in managed fishing areas for several decades, the macaroni penguin Eudyptes ehrysolophus. We use biochemical (stable isotope) and molecular (DNA) analysis of faecal samples collected across the different phases of a single breeding season, and compare the resolved diet to a 26-year dataset of stomach contents collected from a closely located colony (0.25 km apart) that exploits identical foraging grounds. Molecular analysis increased the known target prey species for this highly monitored population by 31%, including a fish species of commercial importance. Biochemical analysis detected subtle changes in the proportion of fish and krill in the diet, demonstrating promising opportunities for using a combined molecular and biochemical method to assess inter-annual foodweb changes at lower trophic levels. The combined approach offers a less invasive sampling methodology, compared to morphological analysis, and provides more information regarding prey species diversity and the overall trophic signature of the diet. Further studies are required to examine the feasibility of using this approach for long-term dietary studies of different marine predator species.";"DNA; Macaroni penguin; Pyrosequencing; Seabird; Stable isotope analysis; Stomach contents";2018;"ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS";"Biodiversity Conservation; Environmental Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Gray wolves (Canis lupus) provide carrion to a suite of scavenger species, including the common raven (Corvus corax). Ravens are wide-ranging and intelligent omnivores that commonly take advantage of anthropogenic food resources. In areas where they overlap with wolves, however, ravens are numerous and ubiquitous scavengers of wolf-acquired carrion. We aimed to determine whether subsidies provided through wolves are a limiting factor for raven populations in general and how the wolf reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park in 1995-1997 affected raven population abundance and distribution on the Yellowstone's Northern Range specifically. We counted ravens throughout Yellowstone's Northern Range in March from 2009 to 2017 in both human-use areas and wolf habitat. We then used statistics related to the local wolf population and the winter weather conditions to model raven abundance during our study period and predict raven abundance on the Northern Range both before and after the wolf reintroduction. In relatively severe winters with greater snowpack, raven abundance increased in areas of human use and decreased in wolf habitat. When wolves were able to acquire more carrion, however, ravens increased in wolf habitat and decreased in areas with anthropogenic resources. Raven populations prior to the wolf reintroduction were likely more variable and heavily dependent on ungulate winter-kill and hunter-provided carcasses. The wolf recovery in Yellowstone helped stabilize raven populations by providing a regular food supply, regardless of winter severity. This stabilization has important implications for effective land management as wolves recolonize the west and global climate patterns change.";"Canis lupus; common raven; Corvus corax; gray wolf; scavenger; Yellowstone National Park";2018;"ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION";"Ecology; Evolutionary Biology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The role of ghrelin on the appetite and fat metabolism in chickens is different from that of ghrelin in mammals. Glucocorticoids and insulin are important hormones and work differently in energy regulation of body. In this study, the effects of dexamethasone (DEX, 2.0 mg/kg BW), subcutaneous insulin injection (40 mu g/kg BW), and glucose load on ghrelin secretion and expression were determined in broilers. DEX treatment increased circulating ghrelin concentration in broiler fed with either a low-energy diet (11.05 MJ/kg of metabolizable energy) or a high-energy diet (14.44 MJ/kg of metabolizable energy). The expression levels of ghrelin were increased while both ghrelin and its receptor GHS-R1a expression levels were stimulated by DEX. A single subcutaneous insulin injection (40 mu g/kg BW) or oral glucose infusion (2 g/kg BW) rise circulating ghrelin level. Ghrelin expression in the proventriculus was increased by insulin treatment but unchanged by glucose load. DEX had no detectable influence on ghrelin and GHS-R1a expression in the hypohtalamus, whereas insulin suppressed their expression. In conclusion, both insulin and glucocorticoid stimulate ghrelin secretion in chickens, in contrast to mammals.

Expanding human enterprise across remote environments impacts numerous wildlife species. Anthropogenic resources provide subsidies for generalist predators that can lead to cascading effects on prey species at lower trophic levels. A fundamental challenge for applied ecologists is to disentangle natural and anthropogenic influences on species occurrence, and subsequently develop spatially explicit models to help inform management and conservation decisions. 2. Using Bayesian hierarchical occupancy models, we mapped the broad-scale occurrence of common ravens Corvus corax as a function of natural and anthropogenic landscape covariates using >15,000 point count surveys performed during 2007-2016 within the Great Basin region, USA. Raven abundance and distribution is substantially increasing across the American west due to unintended anthropogenic resource subsidies. Importantly, ravens prey on eggs and chicks of numerous species including greater sage-grouse Centrocercus urophasianus, an indicator species whose decline is at the centre of national conservation strategies and land-use policies. 3. Anthropogenic factors that contributed to greater raven occurrence were: increased road density, presence of transmission lines, agricultural activity, and presence of roadside rest areas. Natural landscape characteristics included lower elevations with greener vegetation (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), greater stream and habitat edge densities, and lower percentages of big sagebrush Artemisia tridentata spp. 4. Interactions between anthropogenic sources of nesting substrate and food subsidies suggested that raven occurrence increased multiplicatively when these resource subsidies co-occurred. Overall, the average probability of raven occurrence estimated within sagebrush ecosystems of the study area was c. 0.83. 5. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate how anthropogenic factors can be disentangled from natural effects when making spatially explicit predictions of subsidized predators occurring across expansive landscapes. This approach can guide management decisions where subsidized predators overlap sensitive prey habitats. For example, we identify areas where elevated raven occurrence coincides with breeding sage-grouse concentration areas and appears to be largely driven by anthropogenic factors. Management applications could focus on reducing raven access to anthropogenic subsidies in these areas, while prioritizing habitat improvements for sage-grouse elsewhere. Our approach is applicable to other species where widespread survey data are available.";"anthropogenic influences; common raven; greater sage-grouse; occupancy model; predator-prey interactions; sagebrush ecosystems; species distribution model; sensitive prey";2018;"JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY";"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Convertingmarginal croplands to grasslands using conservation programs such as the United States Department of Agriculture Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) should be beneficial for many grassland-obligate wildlife species; however, addition of CRP grasslands may result indifferent population effects based on regional climate, characteristics of the surrounding landscape, or species planted or established. Within landscapes occupied by lesser prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus), CRP may provide habitat only for specific life stages and habitat selection for CRP may vary between wet and dry years. Among all study sites, we captured and fitted 280 female lesser prairie-chickens with very high frequency (VHF)- and global positioning system (GPS) transmitters during the spring lekking seasons of 2013-2015 to monitor habitat selection for CRP in regions of varying climate. We also estimated vital rates and habitat selection for 148 individuals, using sites in northwest Kansas, USA. The greatest ecological services of CRP became apparent when examining habitat selection and densities. Nest densities were approximately 3 times greater in CRP grasslands than native working grasslands (i.e., grazed), demonstrating a population-level benefit (CRP = 6.0 nests/10 km(2) +/- 1.29 [ SE], native working grassland = 1.7 nests/10 km(2) +/- 0.62). However, CRP supporting high nest density did not provide brood habitat; 85% of females with broods surviving to 7 days moved their young to other cover types. Regression analyses indicated lesser prairie-chickens were approximately 8 times more likely to use CRP when 5,000-ha landscapes were 70% rather than 20% grassland, indicating variation in the level of ecological services provided by CRP was dependent upon composition of the larger landscape. Further, CRP grasslands were 1.7 times more likely to be used by lesser prairie-chickens in regions receiving 40 cm compared to 70 cm of average annual precipitation and during years of greater drought intensity. Demographic and resource selection analyses revealed that establishing CRP grasslands in northwest Kansas can increase the amount nesting habitat in a region where it may have previously been limited, thereby providing refugia to sustain populations through periods of extreme drought. Nest survival, adult survival during breeding, and nonbreeding season survival did not vary between lesser prairie-chickens that used and did not use CRP grasslands. The finite rate of population growth was also similar for birds using CRP and using only native working grasslands, suggesting that CRP provides habitat similar to that of native working grassland in this region. Overall, lesser prairie-chickens may thrive in landscapes that are a mosaic of native working grassland, CRP grassland, with a minimal amount of cropland, particularly when nesting and brood habitat are in close proximity.

Finding the right caching site for storage and retrieval is of paramount importance, yet how caching sites are selected is poorly known. Here, we examine site selection for egg caching by a tundra predator, the arctic fox, Vulpes lagopus, which can overcome large seasonal prey variations by extensive caching. During the short arctic summer, colonial breeding birds like geese produce in a short time period many eggs, which provide a large quantity of predictable resources for consumption and caching. We predicted that foxes would select caching sites with specific characteristics, such as shallow permafrost, and tall hummocks (small mounds in tundra landscapes, which should facilitate caching and provide visual cues for subsequent retrieval). We sampled the main physical characteristics of 48 caches and paired random sites inside a Greater Snow Goose (Chen caerulescens) colony. Our study shows that foxes favour cache sites characterized by hummocks nearly twice as higher than at nearby random sites. The depth of the active layer of permafrost did not influence cache site selection. Foxes may select tundra features that possibly enhance caching efficiency and retrieval probability.

Although nest predation is often described as opportunistic, little is known about foraging strategies and nest detection in primates. Since it is the prevalent cause of nest failure in the tropics, birds select nest sites within specific microhabitats and use different nest types to increase nesting success. Identifying the nests targeted by the northern pigtailed macaques (Macaca leonina), an omnivorous cercopithecine species, and known nest predator, will shine light on nest foraging strategies in primates. The aim of this research was to reveal if nest predation is a selective or opportunistic feeding behavior. We studied, using artificial nests and camera traps, the influence of nest type (open-cup vs. cavity), microhabitat (i.e., understory density, canopy cover, canopy height, ground cover, and presence vs. absence of thorns and lianas), and nest height, on nest predation by a troop of northern pigtailed macaques in the Sakaerat Biosphere Reserve (Thailand), a degraded environment. In our study, macaque predation on artificial nests was high; out of the 200 nests that were set up, 112 were plundered by macaques. Although predation rates decreased with nest height, nest type, and microhabitat had no significant effect on predation by macaques. Nest detectability and accessibility did not affect predation rates. Macaques actively searched for nests in different microhabitats, suggesting that nest predation by this primate might be considered a selective feeding behavior in this degraded habitat. Consequently, nest predation by this primate might have important conservation implications on the population dynamics of forest-dwelling bird species. Behavior observation methods, such as instantaneous scan sampling, may underestimate nest predation by primates, a furtive and cryptic behavior.";"camera traps; feeding ecology; Macaca leonina; nest predation; Sakaerat Biosphere Reserve; Thailand";2018;"AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY";"Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

For this reason, managers often use indices of animal abundance. However, indices typically rely on untested assumptions and may be unreliable for estimating population size, status, and trend. Therefore, it is important to test the assumptions underlying indices and to evaluate more rigorous methods of population estimation. Counts of males at leks are used as an index to monitor populations of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), a species of conservation concern, throughout its range in the western United States and Canada. However, not all leks are known, and wildlife managers typically have no rigorous, quantitative estimates of the number of leks and males in any given population. Therefore, it remains unclear what proportion of leks and males are included in, or excluded from, lek-based population status assessments, trend analyses, and management decisions. We used dual-frame surveys, in combination with occupancy analysis to adjust for imperfect detection, to estimate the number of active leks, the number of lekking males, and the proportion of active leks and lekking males counted on annual lek surveys over 3 consecutive breeding seasons in a small, low-density greater sage-grouse population in northwestern Colorado, USA. We estimated that annual lek surveys captured an average of 45-74% of active leks and 43-78% of lekking males each year. Our results suggest that many active leks remain unknown and annual counts fail to account for a substantial, but variable, proportion of the number of active leks and lekking males in the population in any given year. Managers need to recognize this potential source of bias in lek-count data and, if possible, account for it in trend analyses and management efforts. Increased cost likely precludes annual use of dual-frame lek surveys. However, we recommend using analytical methods that account for imperfect detection, mapping potential lek habitat to improve survey efficiency, and conducting dual-frame surveys over multiple years to better understand temporal variation in the proportion of active greater sage-grouse leks and lekking males being counted in specific populations of interest.

These infrastructure impacts may be direct or indirect, the former occurring when development acts directly as an agent of mortality (e.g., collision) and the latter when impacts occur as a by-product of other processes that are altered by infrastructure presence. Functional or numerical responses by predators to power-line corridors are indirect impacts that may suppress demographic rates for certain species, and perceived predation risk may affect animal behaviors such as habitat selection. Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) are a species of conservation concern across western North America that may be affected by power lines. Previous studies, however, have not provided evidence for causal mechanisms influencing demographic rates. Our primary objective was to assess the influence of power lines on multiple sage-grouse vital rates, greater sage-grouse habitat selection, and ultimately greater sage-grouse population dynamics. We used demographic and behavioral data for greater sage-grouse collected from 2003 to 2012 in central Nevada, USA, accounting for sources of underlying environmental heterogeneity. We also concurrently monitored populations of common ravens (Corvus corax), a primary predator of sage-grouse nests and young. We focused primarily on a single 345kV transmission line that was constructed at the beginning of our study; however, we also determined if similar patterns were associated with other nearby, preexisting power lines. We found that numerous behaviors (e.g., nest-site selection, brood-site selection) and demographic rates (e.g., nest survival, recruitment, and population growth) were affected by power lines, and that these negative effects were predominantly explained by temporal variation in the relative abundance of common ravens. Specifically, in years of high common raven abundance, avoidance of the transmission line was extended farther from the line, re-nesting propensity was reduced, and nest survival was lower near the transmission line relative to areas more distant from the transmission line. Additionally, we found that before and immediately after construction of the transmission line, habitats near the footprint of the transmission line were generally more productive (e.g., greater reproductive success and population growth) than areas farther from the transmission line. However, multiple demographic rates (i.e., pre-fledging chick survival, annual male survival, per capita recruitment, and population growth) for groups of individuals that used habitats near the transmission line declined to a greater extent than for individuals using habitats more distant in the years following construction of the transmission line. These decreases were correlated with an increase in common raven abundance. The geographical extent to which power lines negatively influence greater sage-grouse demographic processes was thus contingent on local raven abundance and behavior. In this system, we found that effects of power lines, depending on the behavior or demographic rate, extended 2.5-12.5km, which exceeds current recommendations for the placement of structures in areas around sage-grouse leks. Nests located 12.5km from the transmission line had 0.06 to 0.14 higher probabilities of hatching in years of average to high levels of raven abundance, relative to nests located within 1km of the transmission line. Similarly, leks located 5km from the transmission line had 0.02 to 0.16 higher rates of population growth (lambda) in years of average to high levels of raven abundance, relative to leks located within 1km of the transmission line. Our finding that negative impacts of the transmission line were associated with common raven abundance suggest that management actions that decouple this association between common raven abundance and power lines may reduce the negative indirect impacts of power lines on greater sage-grouse population dynamics. However, because the removal of common ravens or the use of perch deterrents on power lines has not been demonstrated to be consistently effective in reducing common raven predation rates on greater sage-grouse nests, we recommend preferential treatment to mitigation strategies that reduce the number of elevated structures placed within 10km of critical greater sage-grouse habitat.

Recreational hunting is widespread and can benefit nature conservation when well-practised, monitored, and regulated. Management for recreational red grouse Lagopus lagopus scotica shooting on upland heathland in the UK causes conservation conflict because the intensive habitat, predator, and disease management needed to maintain high-grouse densities for ""driven"" shooting has detrimental environmental impacts, notably for raptor populations. 2. Sustainable management of mountain hares Lepus timidus scoticus, a game species in the same landscapes, poses a challenge. Control of transmission to grouse of a viral disease, louping-ill, for which mountain hares are a host, has become an additional motivation to kill mountain hares since research during 1993-2001 suggested that culls might reduce infection rates in grouse. 3. We analysed population trends of mountain hares from spring counts on moorland managed for grouse shooting and on contiguous alpine land. On moorland sites, a long-term decline (4.6% per annum) from 1954 to 1999 increased to 30.7% per annum from then until 2017, with a density index falling to <1% of initial levels after 2008. Before 1999, declines were associated with conifer planting and were least severe where heather burning characteristic of grouse management was present. Grouse moors had the highest rate of decline after 1999. 4. On alpine sites, the density index increased by 2.0% per annum from 1954 to 2007, then declined by 12.3% per annum but remained within the previous range of variation. 5. Despite lack of evidence that it increases grouse numbers, reduction of louping-ill transmission to grouse became a more frequent justification for mountain hare culls at a time consistent with it causing these recent, rapid mountain hare declines on grouse moors. 6. Synthesis and applications. Long-term field counts suggest that intensification of game bird management has resulted in severe, recent declines in mountain hare numbers, exacerbating longer term declines associated with land-use change. Management practices founded on misinterpretation of earlier research are the probable cause. Regulation of hare culling would provide a framework for formal tests of whether culls affect grouse surpluses. It would also provide an opportunity to examine mountain hare populations' resilience to culls of varying size and seasonal timing.";"conservation; disease; favourable conservation status; game bird; hunting; long-term study; predator control; red grouse";2018;"JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY";"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

In addition, groups of animals such as birds have not been used as model in studies in this field, fact that creates an important ecotoxicological gap in them. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of the exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of ZnO nanoparticles on the anti-predatory behavior of chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus). The test animals were daily exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration of ZnO nanoparticles (0.245 mg kg(-1)) and to a toxic concentration of it (245.26 mg kg(-1)) through intraperitoneal injection for two days. We set a control group for comparison purposes. According to our results, ZnO nanoparticles did not affect the locomotor activity of, and did not cause anxiolytic or anxiogenic effect on, birds in the open field test. However, based on the lowest cluster score recorded during the social aggregation test, chicks exposed to ZnO nanoparticles failed to recognize the grunt of a hawk (Rupornis magnirostris) as predatory threat. Only birds in the control group recognized the test snake (Pantherophis guttatus) as potential predator. The higher Zn concentration in the brains of animals exposed to ZnO nanoparticles evidenced the capacity of these nanomaterials to cross the blood-brain barrier, even at low concentrations. This blood-brain barrier crossing could have affected the structures or neuronal mechanisms that modulate the defensive response of birds. Assumingly, even the minimal exposure to low concentrations of ZnO nanoparticles can affect birds. Our outcomes corroborate previous studies about the biological risks of water surface contamination by metal-based nanomaterials. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a non-invasive method (scats), the diet of non-breeding gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua at Bird Island, South Georgia, was examined during the winter of 2009 when local environmental conditions were abnormal (e.g. warmer sea surface waters). Scats were collected every 2 weeks from May until October 2009 (N = 168); the diet was dominated by the amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii by frequency of occurrence (77.5% of the samples) and by number (70.5% of the total individuals). By mass, different species of crustaceans (T. gaudichaudii and Antarctic krill Euphausia superba) and fish (Champsocephalus gunnari, Lepidonotothen larseni and Pseudochaenichthys georgianus) were the most important in different periods. Numerically, prey switching occurred at the end of winter, when E. superba became more abundant in the penguins' diets in late September and early October (austral spring), when sea surface temperatures became colder. T. gaudichaudii is sub-optimal prey for gentoo penguins and its consumption most likely reflects a lack of E. superba in local waters. The consumption of T. gaudichaudii and fish, in place of E. superba, was probably insufficient for the penguins to maintain a body condition suitable for reproduction, contributing to the observed late commencement of breeding (i.e. 2-3 weeks) that year. Our results highlight the sensitivity of gentoo penguin populations to variations in environmental conditions, particularly in terms of how these conditions affect the availability of preferred dietary items and potential follow-on effects in the subsequent breeding season.";"Pygoscelis papua; Southern Ocean; Diet; Antarctic winter; Abnormal environmental conditions";2018;"POLAR BIOLOGY";"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

If the laser-intensity and time required to crystallize biomolecules were to be reduced, laser-induced crystallization may well become of widespread utility.

Research on multiple taxa has shown the differential success of maintaining demographic versus genetic stability and viability in captive populations. In typical captive populations, usually founded by few or related individuals, genetic diversity can be lost and inbreeding can accumulate rapidly, calling into question their ultimate utility for release into the wild. Furthermore, domestication selection for survival in captive conditions is another concern. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the dynamics of population sizes, particularly the effective population size, and genetic diversity at nonneutral and adaptive loci in captive populations. In this study, we assessed effective population sizes and genetic variation at both neutral microsatellite markers, as well as SNP variants from the MHC-B locus of a captive Red Junglefowl population. This population represents a rare instance of a population with a well-documented history in captivity, following a realistic scenario of chain-of-custody, unlike many captive lab populations. Our analyses, which included 27 individuals comprising the entirety of one captive population show very low neutral and adaptive genetic variation, as well as low effective sizes, which correspond with the known demographic history. Finally, our study also shows the divergent impacts of small effective size and inbreeding in captive populations on microsatellite versus adaptive genetic variation in the MHC-B locus.

This species is protected by the Bonn and Berne conventions (1979) and by annex II/I of the Birds Directive (2009). In Algeria, its breeding took place at the hunting centre in the west of the country. Breeding errors caused uncontrolled crosses between the Common quail and Japanese quail Coturnix japonica Temminck & Schlegel, 1849. In order to help to preserve the natural genetic heritage of the Common quail and to lift the ambiguity among the populations of quail raised in Algeria, it seemed essential to begin to describe the chromosomes of this species in the country since no cytogenetic study has been reported to date. Fibroblast cultures from embryo and adult animal were initiated. Double synchronization with excess thymidine allowed us to obtain high resolution chromosomes blocked at prometaphase stage. The karyotype and the idiogram in GTG morphological banding (G-bands obtained with tlypsin and Giemsa) corresponding to larger chromosomes 1-12 and ZW pair were thus established. The diploid set of chromosomes was estimated as 2N=78. Cytogenetic analysis of expected hybrid animals revealed the presence of a genetic introgression and cellular chimerism. This technique is effective in distinguishing the two quail taxa. Furthermore, the comparative chromosomal analysis of the two quails and domestic chicken Gallus gallus domesticto Linnaeus, 1758 has been conducted. Differences in morphology and/or GTG band motifs were observed on 1, 2, 4, 7, 8 and W chromosomes. Neocentromere occurrence was suggested for Common quail chromosome 1 and Chicken chromosomes 4 and W. Double pericentric inversion was observed on the Common quail chromosome 2 while pericentric inversion hypothesis was proposed for Chicken chromosome 8. A deletion on the short arm of the Common quail chromosome 7 was also found. These results suggest that Common quail would be a chromosomally intermediate species between Chicken and Japanese quail. The appearance of only a few intrachromosomal rearrangements that occurred during evolution suggests that the organization of the genome is highly conserved between these three galliform species.";"Avian cytogenetics; cell culture; chimeric hybrids; Coturnix coturnix x Coturnix japonica; GTG-banding; intrachromosomal rearrangements";2018;"COMPARATIVE CYTOGENETICS";"Plant Sciences; Genetics & Heredity; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The study of these ecosystems is usually done using the predator-prey systems. In these ecological studies it has been observed that the quality and quantity of additional food supplements provided play a crucial role in the growth of the predators and thereby influence the eventual state of the ecosystem. Also, in some of the ecological experiments it has been observed that predators exhibit non-optimal foraging behaviour in the presence of additional food. Findings also show that the predators exhibit a Holling type II response towards a target prey with predation highest at low prey densities. The results suggest that predation by predators is unlikely to stabilize low density prey populations. This can be attributed to the prey detectability independent nature of the type II response. In nature, sigmoidal functional responses such as the Holling type Ill response, have been documented in organisms from various taxa. In this kind of type III response the predators exhibit low detectability nature at low prey densities. Due to this the ecosystem tends to get stabilized at low prey densities avoiding the oscillations encountered in type II response. Motivated by these studies, in this paper, we consider a predator-prey system provided with additional food where the predator is assumed to exhibit Holling type III functional response towards the available food and the additional food supplements provided are assumed to be of constant density. We also assume that the predators are not optimal foragers. The model is analyzed in the control parameter space using the control parameters, quality and quantity of additional food. It is observed that the system exhibits apparent competition only when the predators are provided with high quality additional food supplements. Further, it has been shown that the ecosystem tends to get stabilized at low prey densities and the system can be steered to a desired state by a suitable choice of additional food supplements. Provision of low quality additional food supplements can result in completely opposite results to the expected ones. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, we focused on genes relating to the immune system and metabolism. We analyzed liver samples from free-ranging chickens in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, for contamination by DDTs. This area predominantly uses DDT in its malaria control program, and homes are sprayed annually with the pesticide. Genes relating to the immune system and metabolism were selected as potential genetic biomarkers that could be linked to higher contamination with DDTs. RT-qPCR analysis on 39 samples showed strong correlations between DDTs contamination and mRNA expression for the following genes: AvBD1, AvBD2, AvBD6 and AvBD7(down-regulated), and CYP17, ELOVL2 and SOLE (up-regulated). This study shows for the first time interesting and significant correlations between genetic material collected from environmentally-exposed chickens and mRNA expression of several genes involved in immunity and metabolism. These findings show the usefulness of analysis on field samples from a region with high levels of environmental contamination in detecting potential biomarkers of exposure. In particular, we observed clear effects from DDT contamination on mRNA expression of genes involved in immune suppression, endocrine-disrupting effects, and lipid dysregulation.

The willow ptarmigan inhabits alpine-and arctic tundra habitats in the northern hemisphere and is listed as near threatened (NT) in the Norwegian red list due to declining population size. Habitat alteration is one of several factors affecting willow ptarmigan populations, but there is a lack of studies quantifying and describing habitat selection in willow ptarmigan. We used data from an extensive line transect survey program from 2014 to 2017 to develop resource selection functions (RSF) for willow ptarmigan in Norway. The selection coefficients for the RSF were estimated using a mixed-effects logistic regression model fitted with random intercepts for each area. We predicted relative probability of selection across Norway and quantile-binned the predictions in 10 RSF bins ranging from low-(1) to high-(10) relative probability of selection. Results: Random cross-validation suggest that our models were highly predictive, but validation based spatial blocking revealed that the predictability was better in southern parts of Norway compared to the northernmost region. Willow ptarmigan selected for herb-rich meadows and avoided lichen rich heathlands. There was generally stronger selection for vegetation types with dense field layer and for rich bogs and avoidance of vegetation types with sparse field layer cover and for lowland forest. Further, willow ptarmigan selected for areas around the timberline and for intermediate slopes. Mapping of the RSF showed that 60% of Norway is in the lowest ranked RSF bin and only 2% in the highest ranked RSF bin. Conclusions: Willow ptarmigan selected for vegetation types with dense field layer and bogs at intermediate slopes around the timberline. Selection coincides with previous habitat selection studies on willow ptarmigan. This is the first attempt to assess and quantify habitat selection for willow ptarmigan at a large scale using data from line transect distance sampling surveys. Spatial variation in predictability suggests that habitat selection in late summer might vary from north to south.

The Common quail Coturnix coturnbc is a migratory species characterized by its itinerant breeding (several breeding attempts in different places) and exposure to high mortality rates, and it is a case in point. The identification and management of high quality nesting areas is essential to conserve this and other migratory species. Here, we use a Spanish long-term quail ringing dataset (1961-2014) to correlate population age structure with temporal and geographical variables. We show that northern Mediterranean regions provide optimal breeding sites and have balanced population age structures (young:adult males). The proportion of young:adult males provides an indicator of the relative quality of various breeding areas. Records of ringed quail provide data on the overlap between young and adult males temporarily resident in different geographic areas and may provide a useful tool to evaluate habitat quality. We found that the timing of sequential breeding attempts and temporary residency of quail are associated with latitude, altitude, and geographic location of quail ringing records. In southern regions, young males arrive at the breeding area later than adults, while in northern regions young birds and adults arrive at same time. Optimal breeding areas are characterized by high quality habitat, have high quail densities, and a mixture of young and adult males, factors that favour sexual selection, heterozygosity and population viability. However, not all high quality habitat areas are suitable for reproduction, being necessary enough quail density and the adequate proportion of young:adult males.";"Age structure; Young-adult overlap; Nesting area; Geographical zone; High quality habitat; Itinerant reproduction";2018;"ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS";"Biodiversity Conservation; Environmental Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Where the Great Plains meet the sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) steppe, an opportunity exists to conserve habitat for the two most imperiled avian guilds in North America, grassland and shrub-steppe birds. This ecotone creates a unique challenge with respect to the management of disturbance processes, such as fire and grazing, because grassland and sagebrush-shrubland birds respond quite dissimilarly to disturbance. To address this management challenge and maximize conservation opportunities, we examined the responses of grassland and sagebrush bird communities to disturbance at a grassland-sagebrush ecotone in northeast Wyoming, USA. Specifically, we surveyed bird communities on active black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies and burned areas, as well as on paired undisturbed points in 2016 and 2017. Bird community structure varied in response to both the presence and type of disturbance. Although alpha diversity of avian species was highest on undisturbed sites and burned areas, only prairie dog colonies provided breeding habitat for the imperiled shortgrass-obligate mountain plover (Charadrius montanus), and species turnover (beta diversity) was greatest between on-colony and off-colony points. Furthermore, bird communities were shaped by both disturbance-dependent (e.g., disturbance age) and disturbance-independent (e.g., topography and soils) landscape features. Managers must balance the benefits of high species diversity in undisturbed sagebrush with habitat requirements of other imperiled species like the mountain plover.

One cost is that reproduction decreases survival probabilities of attendant individuals, which may have a major effect on population demography. During brood rearing, adults of precocial species usually make extensive movements to lead their young to sites with adequate food resources and dense cover. However, few studies have evaluated the effects of brood movement on attendant precocial adults. In this study, we tracked female Chinese Grouse during brood-rearing periods using radiotelemetry at Lianhuashan Nature Reserve, Gansu, China, during 2010-2012, to evaluate the effects of brood rearing and movement distances on females' survival probabilities using known fate models in program MARK. All 41 females attempted to breed, and 30 females successfully hatched at least one chick; 11 failed during the incubation period. Although females with broods moved more extensively than females without broods, movement distances did not influence survival probabilities of attendant females. Seven females with broods were killed by predators, resulting in a lower survival probability (0.958 +/- 0.016 weekly survival and 0.679 +/- 0.099 through the 9-weeks brood-rearing periods) than for females without broods, which all survived the brood-rearing periods.

A total of 550 day-old Japanese quail chicks were allocated into 11 dietary treatments of 5 replications (10 birds in each cage) under a randomized experimental design. The treatments were a basal diet (Control), or 3 levels (200, 300, and 400 ppm) of thyme essential oil (TO), or 3 levels (200, 300, and 400 ppm) of savory essential oil (SO), or 3 levels (200, 300, and 400 ppm) of pennyroyal essential oil (PO) added separately to the basal diet, or also the basal diet supplemented with 100 ppm of flavophospholipol. Body weight gain (BWG), feed intake (FI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were measured weekly and calculated totally for 35 d. The organs weight and morphology of intestine parts of one bird from each cage were measured on 35 d. At the same day, blood samples were collected and cholesterol and triglyceride values were separately determined for male and female quails. Although the addition of different levels of essential oils in quail's diet did not affect BWG, a significant decline in FI was observed in the group supplemented with 400 ppm of TO. At the same time, FCR significantly improved (P < 0.05) in the same group as well as in the group supplemented with the antibiotic. However, the organs weight was not significantly affected by the experimental treatments. Nevertheless, villi height of duodenum, jejunum and ileum was significantly increased and crypt depth was significantly decreased in the quails fed diets supplemented with different levels of TO and SO. The values of serum triglycerides decreased in both sexes in the groups that received diets supplemented with different levels of essential oils whereas the values of cholesterol decreased only in males of the essential oils supplemented groups. From the present observations it can be concluded that thyme and savory essential oils can improve FCR by decreasing FI through boosting the absorption of nutrients in intestine. These plant essential oils can replace antibiotic growth parameters without having any adverse effect on quail's health with thyme essential oil exerting the most effective activity.";"Agriculture; Veterinary medicine; Food science; Zoology; Plant biology; Physiology";2018;"HELIYON";"Multidisciplinary Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

However, resource selection is both a scale-and a life-stage-specific process, in which the importance of different resources may vary among spatial scales of selection and phases of species' life cycles. We investigated multilevel resource selection and summer survival of Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus) in Maine, USA, to understand life-stage-specific resource selection and the cost of brood rearing. At the landscape level, male Ruffed Grouse selected areas with greater densities of woody stems taller than breast height, while females avoided these areas and selected areas with greater ground coverage by Rubus. Males further selected areas with greater stem densities at the local level, while females again avoided areas with greater stem densities and selected locally available areas with greater ground coverage by Rubus. Weekly survival rates (6 SE) were reduced for females that were actively tending broods (S = 0.9393 6 0.0294) when compared with nonreproductive individuals (both males and nonbrooded females; S = 0.9966 +/- 0.0034). These differences in survival based on reproductive status were better supported than a difference associated solely with sex and resulted in a 69% chance that a female would survive raising a brood to 6 wk, compared with a 98% chance of survival for nonreproductive birds over the same 6 wk period. Our results suggest that male Ruffed Grouse selected resources that reduced their mortality risk, thereby investing in survival and their future reproductive potential, whereas brood-rearing females selected resources to benefit current reproduction and incurred a cost to their own survival in the process.";"Bonasa umbellus; mortality; radio telemetry; resource selection; seasonal habitat";2018;"AUK";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We used a combination of capture-recapture and harvest information from a 42 yr dataset to create an integrated population model that estimates population abundance, annual survival, and per capita recruitment in Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). We evaluated the associations of commonly reported population metrics (age ratios from harvests, annual survival, and recruitment) to population growth rate using correlation analysis. We also modeled the effects of population abundance, breeding-season temperature, breeding-season precipitation, fall minimum temperature, and fall precipitation on recruitment. Recruitment averaged 1.55 (range: 0.82-2.21) and was most strongly correlated with population growth (r = 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.63-0.88), followed by annual survival (r = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.09-0.61). We found a weak correlation between fall age ratios and population growth rate (r = 0.11, 95% CI: -0.19 to 0.40).

Nevertheless, research on individual variation in animal cognition is still limited. Further, although individual cognitive abilities have been suggested to be linked to personality (i.e., consistent behavioral differences among individuals), few studies have linked performance across multiple cognitive tasks to personality traits. Thus, the interplays between cognition and personality are still unclear. We therefore investigated the relationships between an important aspect of cognition, learning, and personality, by exposing young and adult red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) to multiple learning tasks (discriminative, reversal, and spatial learning) and personality assays (novel arena, novel object, and tonic immobility). Learning speed was not correlated across learning tasks, and learning speed in discrimination and spatial learning tasks did not co-vary with personality. However, learning speed in reversal tasks was associated with individual variation in exploration, and in an age-dependent manner. More explorative chicks learned the reversal task faster than less explorative ones, while the opposite association was found for adult females (learning speed could not be assayed in adult males). In the same reversal tasks, we also observed a sex difference in learning speed of chicks, with females learning faster than males. Our results suggest that the relationship between cognition and personality is complex, as shown by its task- and age-dependence, and encourage further investigation of the causality and dynamics of this relationship.Significance statementIn the ancestor of today's chickens, the red junglefowl, we explored how personality and cognition relate by exposing both chicks and adults to several learning tasks and personality assays. Our birds differed in personality and learning speed, while fast learners in one task did not necessarily learn fast in another (i.e., there were no overall smarter birds). Exploration correlated with learning speed in the more complex task of reversal learning: faster exploring chicks, but slower exploring adult females, learned faster, compared to less explorative birds. Other aspects of cognition and personality did not correlate. Our results suggest that cognition and personality are related, and that the relationship can differ depending on task and age of the animal.";"Exploration; Cognition; Gallus gallus; Personality";2018;"BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY";"Behavioral Sciences; Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

In the next 3years, respiratory infection by Cryptosporidium baileyi had manifested itself in Grouse on half the moors in northern England and 80% of moors in the North Pennine Hills. In this first account of the impact of respiratory cryptosporidiosis on the population dynamics of a wild bird we fitted 111 diseased and 67 healthy Grouse with radio-transmitters at two North Pennine moors where disease prevalence averaged 8.1% and monitored their survival and fecundity between autumn 2013 and autumn 2015. Six-month natural survival rates (excluding shooting) were 0.70 in healthy Grouse, but only 0.44 in diseased females, and 0.22 in diseased males. Some 39% of diseased birds died from their infection, whereas 28% of healthy birds were shot. A similar proportion of each group were killed by predators, either by Stoat Mustela erminea or raptors. Diseased females bred 8days later than healthy females, but clutch size, egg volume and nesting success did not differ in relation to disease status. Productivity was 43% lower among pairs with a diseased member than in healthy pairs, but appeared impaired only if the female was diseased, not the male. Differences in productivity were related to chick survival rather than the proportion of pairs that reared broods, with chick survival being lower in the 10days after hatching and again when chicks were 20-50days old. This latter period was when respiratory infection among chicks was first noticed and the onset of infection may have been a contributing factor to higher mortality during this period. Described levels of respiratory infection reduced the number of birds available to shoot in August by 6%, which represented a mean annual loss of 0.9 pound million in revenue across managed grouse moors. Likely reductions in shoot economics could escalate should prevalence increase. This disease is a welfare concern and potentially a conservation concern, too, should infection cross to other bird species occupying the same moors.";"Cryptosporidium baileyi; game shooting; infection; Lagopus lagopus scotica; parasitic protozoan; productivity; Willow Ptarmigan";2018;"IBIS";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Based on their body weight gain from 1 to 5 days of age, 5-day-old chicks (Gallus gallus domestics) were divided into a slow-growing and a fast-growing group, the mean weight gains of which were 6.3 +/- 1.3 g/day and 11.3 +/- 0.9 g/day, respectively. The ratio of pectoral muscle weight to total body weight was higher in the fast-growing group of chicks than in the slow-growing group. In addition, the plasma 3-methylhistidine concentration, an index of protein degradation in skeletal muscle, was significantly lower in the fast-growing than in the slow-growing chicks. The mRNA expression of beta(2)-AR, which we previously found is involved in decreasing muscle protein degradation by suppression atrogin-1/MAFbx mRNA expression, was significantly higher in the pectoral muscle of the fast-growing group compared with that of the slow-growing group. Concordantly, lower mRNA expression of atrogin-1/MAFbx was observed in the pectoral muscle of the fast-growing chicks. However, in the sartorius muscle, which is a muscle in the thigh, the ratio of the muscle weight to total body weight was not significantly different between the two groups of chicks at 5 days of age. In addition, there was no significant difference in the mRNA expressions of beta(2)-AR and atrogin-1/MAFbx in the sartorius muscle between these two groups.

The willow ptarmigan is a popular but red-listed small game species, and it is challenging for managers to optimize harvest levels based on uncertain population estimates and limited knowledge of the factors influencing hunting impact. We studied how willow ptarmigan hunting effort, catch per unit effort, and harvest rates were influenced by ptarmigan density, topography, vegetation, and infrastructure. Data were collected during 2013-2016 from 162 hunting blocks covering 26,828km(2) state-owned land in the counties Nordland and Troms, northern Norway. Hunting effort averaged 1.27days/km(2) (SD=2.08), and it was the highest in areas close to roads and cabins. We found an opposite effect on the catch per unit effort (CPUE, mean=0.77 ptarmigan/day, SD=0.48), which was lower close to roads. There was a marked positive effect of density on CPUE, whereas terrain steepness (slope) had a negative effect. On average, harvest removed <10% of the autumn population in the hunting areas during the study period. This indicates a relatively low and partially compensatory hunting mortality in most years and areas. Although this study shows a low harvest rate, we recommend managers to survey ptarmigan populations, hunting effort, and harvest, especially in easily accessible areas close to infrastructure and in periods of low population density.";"Small game; Lagopus lagopus; CPUE; Hunting effort; Overharvest; Sustainability";2018;"EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

However, there is a lack of related knowledge on birds. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to determine if cytokines are associated with reduced food intake in chicks (Gallus galls). Specifically, we evaluated the effects of TNF-like cytokine 1A (TL1A), a member of the TNF family, interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) on food intake. Additionally, the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) on cytokine mRNA expression in the diencephalon and spleen was also measured. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of 0.05 or 03 mu g TL1A, IFN-alpha, and IFN-gamma had no effect on food intake. However, when 1.0 mu g each of these factors was evaluated, TL1A significantly decreased food intake at 180 and 240 min after the injection, but IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma had no effect. When chicks received intraperitoneal (IP) injections of 100 mu g LPS or 400 mu g poly I:C, their food intake was reduced. Diencephalic mRNA expression of TL1A was significantly decreased following IP injection of LPS or poly I:C. Additionally, diencephalic mRNA expression of IFN-gamma mRNA was significantly increased by IP injection of LPS but decreased by IP injection of poly I:C. For the spleen, IP injection of LPS and poly I:C both significantly increased TL1A and IFN-gamma mRNA expression. In sum, we have provided evidence that central TL1A but not IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma are related to reduction of food intake in chicks, but the role of these cytokines for mediating anorexia associated with infections may differ from mammals.";"Chick; Feeding; Interferon; Lipopolysaccharide; Polyinosinic:Polycytidylic acid; Tumor necrosis factor-like cytokine 1A";2018;"PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR";"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Such practices are thought to be a severe threat for the native species as it could lead to introgression of domestic Japanese quail alleles into the wild common quail genome and potentially alter the migratory and reproductive behaviour in wild populations. In this study, we assessed the genetic purity of a captive population of common quail that was established from wild-caught founders caught on the Southern Italian coast in Sicily (Italy). We evaluated the proportion of ancestry to common and Japanese quail in this captive population via genetic screening using nuclear microsatellite markers and mitochondrial DNA analyses. We showed that the captive farm quail in our study had no sign of admixture with domestic Japanese quail and had similar genotype frequencies relative to wild common quail, confirming the success of the breeding programme for the native species.

At 21st day, chicks that pipped successfully were euthanized and dissected for assessing the PB caused effects on phenotypes and the liver transcriptome in both genders. In the PB treatment group, a 7% attenuation in tarsus length was found in females.

PB exposure modulated the genes primarily enriched in the biological pathways of the cancer, cardiac development, immune response, lipid metabolism, and skeletal development in both genders, and altered expressions of genes related to the cellular process and neural development in females.

We used the ""research area"" option to filter articles focused on the zoology, environmental sciences ecology, biodiversity conservation, forestry, behavioral sciences, reproductive biology, biochemistry and molecular biology, cell biology, genetics and heredity, evolutionary biology, physiology and developmental biology. We then checked duplication based on the title, abstract and full text. In addition, we examined the reference lists of selected studies to include the publications that were missed by above searching. Results: We retained 1874 articles related to the Galliformes from the initial 243,128 publications that were found. About 91.4% focused on one or two species, and 85.0% were conducted within a short duration, typically 1-2 years. The majority of the articles concentrated on macroscopic ecology (55.5%), mainly focusing on habitat selection or habitat use. With recent advances of molecular biology, the studies of taxonomy and phylogenetics rose quickly in last two decades. The study of physiology and biochemistry was no longer limited to simple description but expanded to the mechanisms of phenotype and micro-evolutionary potential. An additional area receiving increasing attention is the conservation of Galliformes, with the assessment of the conservation status and conservation management effectiveness of Galliformes (e.g. species diversity and genetic diversity) becoming the focus. Conclusions: The studies on Galliformes have made great achievements since 1990, but there are still gaps, particularly in macroscopic ecology, molecular genetics, and conservation. There is an urgent need to enhance long-term monitoring and analysis of population dynamics, and applying different disciplines to galliform conservation. Moreover, life history information of many galliform species is still lacking, which has hindered conservation efforts and effectiveness. In addition, multidiscipline studies and new technologies are not common for galliform studies, and should be encouraged.";"Galliformes; Web of Science; Research advances; Future prospects";2018;"AVIAN RESEARCH";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

A growing number of studies demonstrate a positive relationship between performance in psychometric tasks and (proxy) measures of fitness. We assayed the performance of 154 common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) chicks on tests of acquisition and reversal learning, using a different set of chicks and different set of cue types (spatial location and colour) in each of two years and then followed their fates after release into the wild. Across all birds, individuals that were slow to reverse previously learned associations were more likely to survive to four months old. For heavy birds, individuals that rapidly acquired an association had improved survival to four months, whereas for light birds, slow acquirers were more likely to be alive. Slow reversers also exhibited less exploratory behaviour in assays when five weeks old. Fast acquirers visited more artificial feeders after release. In contrast to most other studies, we showed that apparently ` poor' cognitive performance (slow reversal speed suggesting low behavioural flexibility) correlates with fitness benefits in at least some circumstances.

It is, therefore, crucial to determine the relative extent of genetic versus environmental control of these among-individual differences in cognitive traits to understand their causes and evolutionary potential. We investigated heritability of associative learning performance and of a cognitive judgement bias (optimism), as well as their covariation, in a captive pedigree-bred population of red junglefowl (Gallus gallus, n. 300 chicks over 5 years). We analysed performance in discriminative and reversal learning (two facets of associative learning), and cognitive judgement bias, by conducting animal models to disentangle genetic from environmental contributions. We demonstrate moderate heritability for reversal learning, and weak to no heritability for optimism and discriminative learning, respectively. The two facets of associative learning were weakly negatively correlated, consistent with hypothesized trade-offs underpinning individual cognitive styles. Reversal, but not discriminative learning performance, was associated with judgement bias; less optimistic individuals reversed a previously learnt association faster. Together these results indicate that genetic and environmental contributions differ among traits. While modular models of cognitive abilities predict a lack of common genetic control for different cognitive traits, further investigation is required to fully ascertain the degree of covariation between a broader range of cognitive traits and the extent of any shared genetic control.

Thus, the aim of our study is to assess the impact of exposure to water with ABA for 40 days at predicted environmentally relevant concentrations on the behavior of female Japanese quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica). The three following experimental groups (n= 10 each) were set: ""control"", quails exposed to drinking water, without ABA, ""EC1x"" and ""EC1000x"" (0.31 mg a. i./L and 310.0 a. i./L, respectively; via commercial formulation Kraft (R) 36EC). The open field test showed anxiolytic response in birds exposed to ABA. These birds did not show locomotor changes or aggressive behavior in the aggressiveness test. Quails exposed to the pesticide did not react to the introduction of an object in the experimental box during the object recognition test, and it suggested perception deficit due to ABA. Moreover, these birds did not recognize the cat (Felix catus) and the vocalization of a hawk (Rupornis magnirostris) as potential predatory threats. These responses also suggest antipredatory behavior deficit due to the pesticide. Thus, our study is pioneer in showing that water with ABA, at tested concentrations, influences the behavior of C. coturnix japonica, as well as in highlighting the potential impacts of this pesticide on this group of birds.

However, selection for parthenogenesis in both the dam and sire leads to a reduction in hatchability following mating. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine if selection for parthenogenesis in the dam, sire, or both also impact their progeny performance. There were 2 lines of birds used in this trial: 1 line selected for parthenogenesis and 1 line not selected for parthenogenesis (control) yielding breeding pairs as follows: control dams + control sires (CC), control dams + parthenogenetic sires (CP), parthenogenetic dams + control sires (PC), and parthenogenetic dams + parthenogenetic sires (PP). For all progeny, a dam line main effect revealed that the parthenogenetic line dams had heavier offspring hatch weight and 4 wk body weight as well as higher 1st wk chick mortality versus control line dams. However, control line dams had the highest 4th wk chick mortality versus parthenogenetic line dams. In female virgin progeny, a dam by sire interaction revealed that PP, PC, and CP had the heaviest 1st egg in the clutch position versus CC. Also, eggs from PP had the highest number of eggs and the most female progeny exhibiting parthenogenesis versus CC. There was a linear increase in egg weight as clutch position increased for progeny from PP and CC yet a linear decline for CP. In conclusion, it appears that both the dam and sire selected for parthenogenesis impact progeny performance as parthenogenetic dams and sires additively contribute to the degree of parthenogenesis exhibited by virgin female progeny. Moreover, because parthenogenesis is known to exist in the modern poultry industry, even the accidental selection of the parthenogenetic trait in either males or females could have a negative impact on overall chick production and performance.

Also, hens that exhibit parthenogenesis have shorter clutches and heavier egg weights. These larger eggs may be a result of the egg residing in the oviduct longer, allowing more time for the parthenote to develop. However, it is unknown which components of the egg are altered due to the parthenogenetic trait or the role of dams and sires from the parthenogenetic line of quails in these alterations. Therefore, our objective was to determine if the parthenogenetic trait in dams, sires, or both contributes to alterations in egg components, such as yolk, albumen, and shell weights. Two selected lines of quail, 1 line selected for parthenogenesis and 1 line that was unselected for the parthenogenetic trait (control), were utilized in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of dam and sire lines to create 4 breeding treatments: control dams + control sires (CC), control dams + parthenogenetic sires (CP), parthenogenetic dams + control sires (PC), parthenogenetic dams + parthenogenetic sires (PP). Daily, fresh eggs were collected, labeled, weighed, and the germinal disc was classified as fertile, unfertilized without development, or parthenote. Yolk, albumen, and shell weights were obtained, and their weights were also calculated as percentage of total egg weight. A dam main effect revealed heavier weights for total egg, yolk, albumen, and shell as well as a larger percentage of albumen and ratio of albumen to yolk in parthenogenetic line dams versus control line dams. However, the percentage of yolk was higher for control than parthenogenetic line dams. The increase in total egg and egg component weights due to the parthenogenetic trait suggests that the transit time of the egg through the oviduct is altered. Perhaps transit through the magnum and uterus is delayed the most yielding greater albumen and shell weights, respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have been endemic in Egypt since 2006, and the co-circulation of high-pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 and low-pathogenic avian influenza H9N2 subtypes in poultry has been reported; therefore, Egypt is considered a hotspot for the generation of new subtypes and genotypes. We aimed to characterize AIVs circulating on commercial farms and in live bird markets (LBMs) during the winters of 2015 and 2016 in the study area and to identify H5N1 and H9N2 viruses in respiratory patients. Methods. In total, 159 samples were collected from ducks, pigeons and quails on farms (n = 59) and in LBMs (n = 100) and screened by real-time RT-PCR for H5N1 and H9N2 subtypes. Clinical and postmortem examination was carried out on birds from the farms. Positive H5N1 samples were sequenced and analysed for mutations. Tracheal swabs were also collected from 89 respiratory patients admitted to respiratory hospitals in the same study area. Results. Overall, H5N1 was identified in 13.6% of birds from farms, while it was detected in 17% of birds in LBMs. Subtype H9N2 was only identified from pigeons on farms (6.5%) and LBMs (11.4%). Sequencing of the haemagglutination gene (HA) in nine representative H5N1 isolates revealed a multi-basic amino acid motif at the cleavage site (321-PQGEKRRKKR/GLF-333), which is characteristic of highly pathogenic AIV, in five of our isolates, while the other four isolates showed an amino acid substitution (Q322K) at this cleavage site to make it (321-P K GEKRRKKR/GLF-333). All the isolates belonged to clade 2.2.1.2, and a comparison of HA sequences at the amino acid level showed 98.8-100% homology among the nine isolates, while they showed 94.1-96.1% identity with reference strains and the commonly used vaccine strain in Egypt. Out of 89 respiratory patients, 3.4% were positive for H5N1 and no patients were positive for H9N2. Discussion. Our results indicated the circulation of the endemic H5N1 and H9N2 viruses among poultry in 2015 and 2016. Birds on farms and in LBMs are reservoirs playing a role in the dissemination of the virus and producing a public health risk. The application of proper hygienic measures in farms and LBMs to control the exposure of birds and humans to the source of infection along with continuous monitoring of the circulating viruses will provide information on understanding the evolution of the viruses for vaccine studies.";"Avian Influenza Viruses; H5N1; H9N2; Mutation";2018;"PEERJ";"Multidisciplinary Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We investigated the degree to which habitat degradation and habitat loss impacted the breeding ecology of Greater Prairie-Chickens at 3 study sites across relatively intact grasslands in Kansas, USA. Across all 3 study systems, we found similar rates of multiple mating by females at 14-20% of broods. In addition, we found evidence for facultative nest parasitism of conspecific females. Prairie-chicken females inhabiting more intact and less fragmented landscapes with a higher probability of survival did not engage in parasitic egg laying, whereas similar to 17% of females inhabiting a more fragmented and isolated landscape engaged in parasitic egg laying. Parasitic egg layers tended to be older females that parasitized nests of yearling females. Parasitic egg layers only laid parasitically after an initial nesting attempt failed. Parasitic laying females all renested and hatched their own clutches. When counting parasitically laid eggs, parasitic egg-laying females laid significantly more eggs than nonparasitic egg layers and, as a result, had 25% greater fecundity. This case study across the relatively intact grasslands of Kansas highlights how land use and management can influence adaptive life history traits and population stability.

We conducted vegetation surveys at nest sites (n=90) of radio-tagged Greater Sage-Grouse and paired random locations across 2 breeding seasons (2014-2015).

We used generalized linear models and information theory to evaluate competing hypotheses about nest site selection.

Mountain big sagebrush and three-tip sagebrush provided twice the amount of lateral cover that basin big sagebrush shrubs provided.

Why has sexual reproduction become so complicated? Why have such exaggerated sexual traits evolved? Early work posited a connection between multicellularity and sexual traits such as anisogamy (i.e., the evolution of small sperm and large eggs). Anisogamy then drives the evolution of other forms of sexual dimorphism. Yet the relationship between multicellularity and the evolution of sexual traits has not been empirically tested. Given their extensive variation in both multicellular complexity and sexual systems, the volvocine green algae offer a tractable system for understanding the interrelationship of multicellular complexity and sex. Here we show that species with greater multicellular complexity have a significantly larger number of derived sexual traits, including anisogamy, internal fertilization, and secondary sexual dimorphism. Our results demonstrate that anisogamy repeatedly evolved from isogamous multicellular ancestors and that anisogamous species are larger and produce larger zygotes than isogamous species. In the volvocine algae, the evolution of multicellularity likely drives the evolution of anisogamy, and anisogamy subsequently drives secondary sexual dimorphism.

In a variety of species, spacing between males influences the likelihood that females visit particular individuals or respond to competing signals. Discrimination by females is expected to be highest among neighbouring males, yet males of some species aggregate in ways that apparently facilitate such comparisons. To better understand the selective pressures affecting male aggregation, we investigated how spatial organization of male territories related to female mate sampling tactics and male mating success in the lance-tailed manakin, Chiroxiphia lanceolata. This species displays in a dispersed lek of alpha males, each of which usually has a subordinate beta partner that participates in displays but does not mate with females attracted by their cooperative courtship. We video-recorded courtship activity at display perches of 12 alpha-beta pairs for 42 days in 2013, and documented 478 visits by 82 banded females. We further quantified the relationship of aggregation with genetic mating success for 49 alphas displaying at georeferenced locations in 5 years. Males with close neighbouring alphas were visited by more females, but geographic centrality was unrelated to female visit frequency. Females moved shorter distances between consecutive courtship visits than expected at random, but only 20.5% of 73 females visiting males with video-monitored nearest neighbours visited both neighbouring alpha males. Effects of aggregation on annual genetic reproductive success were only evident after accounting for the stronger effects of alpha age and experience, and only experienced alphas benefited from having close neighbours. Selection for aggregation more likely influences social behaviour of older alphas than settlement decisions by younger males. Benefits of aggregation for experienced alphas mitigate declines in old age, and may generate selective pressure favouring the long-term social alliances that are a key characteristic of this mating system.

Copper (Cu) is an essential microelement, which participates in OxS as a cofactor for certain enzymes, with narrow optimal range between essential and toxic concentrations. However, their effects are rarely studied in chicken skeletal muscles, which have soaring per capita consumption andare susceptible to oxidative damage. In the present study, we demonstrated that the administration of copper sulfate (300 mg kg(-1)) or arsenite (30 mg kg(-1)) individually or their co-administration leads to varying degrees of OxS in the skeletal muscles of chickens. Corresponding to the protein expression pattern, the mRNA levels of caspase, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) families, and autophagy-related genes were also compromised in the experimental groups, indicating the involvement of both apoptotic and autophagic cell death. Additionally, rampant mitochondrial fission caused the vicious cycle between imbalanced mitochondrial dynamics and OxS, thus tethering intracellular homeostasis. The abovementioned muscle damage and index anomalies were time dependent, and more deteriorated effects were observed in Cu2+ and arsenite co-administered groups than those in groups administered Cu2+ and arsenite alone. Intriguingly, in the studied skeletal muscles, namely wing biceps brachii and leg gastrocnemius, there were conspicuous differences in oxidative toxicity susceptibility, which needs further study. The present study showed that Cu and/or As induce oxidative damage in chicken skeletal muscles and discussed its mechanism in terms of apoptosis, autophagy, and mitochondrial dynamics, thus voicing concerns about poultry breeding areas cross-contaminated with Cu2+ and arsenite.

Widespread, long-term population declines in greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) have elicited concern about negative effects of livestock grazing on sage-grouse populations. Hypothesized relationships, mostly untested, between livestock and sage-grouse nesting ecology have played a prominent role in shaping public land livestock grazing policy and broader discussions about management of grazing in sagebrush ecosystems. We tested predictions arising from several commonly hypothesized mechanisms by which livestock may affect nesting habitat quality for sage-grouse in a grazed landscape in central Montana, USA. We employed Bayesian variable selection methods to identify factors related to both nest site selection and nest success, focusing on indices of livestock use at local and pasture scales and including other factors known to influence nesting ecology such as anthropogenic features and weather. In spite of some evidence nest survival was positively associated with senesced vegetation height, evidence for effects of livestock presence and indices of local livestock use on nest site selection and survival was equivocal at best. In contrast, we found strong evidence that females selected nest sites based on relatively static features such as sagebrush cover and distance from gravel and paved roads, whereas nest failure was driven primarily by extended periods of heavy precipitation. Management of sage-grouse nesting habitat in this region should focus on conserving areas of adequate shrub cover and preventing further fragmentation by roads. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.

Grazing was annually managed with the objective of achieving 50% utilization of aboveground vegetation biomass. We used lek (n=49) count data and covariates of weather and managed grazing to: (a) estimate long-term lesser prairie-chicken abundance and compare abundance predrought and postdrought; (b) examine the influence of annual and seasonal drought (modified Palmer drought index), temperature, and precipitation on long-term lesser prairie-chicken survival and recruitment; and (c) assess and compare the influence of grazing on lesser prairie-chicken population predrought and postdrought. Lesser prairie-chicken abundance was nearly seven times greater predrought than postdrought, and population declines were attributed to decreased survival and recruitment. The number of days with temperature >90th percentile had the greatest effect, particularly on recruitment. The population exhibited a substantial bust during 2011 and 2012 without a boom to recover in four postdrought years. Adaptive grazing positively influenced the population predrought, but had no effects postdrought. Results suggest that the severe drought in 2011 may have been beyond the range of environmental conditions to which lesser prairie-chickens, and likely other species, have adapted. Land management practices, such as grazing, should remain adaptive to ensure potential negative influences to all species are avoided. Increasing habitat quantity and quality by reducing habitat loss and fragmentation likely will increase resiliency of the ecosystem and individual species.";"climate change; drought; grazing; lesser prairie-chicken; sand shinnery oak grasslands; Southern High Plains";2018;"ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION";"Ecology; Evolutionary Biology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Here, we report multiannual defense, growth, and reproductive responses of MeJA-treated bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and neighboring ramets. In a boreal forest in western Norway, we treated bilberry ramets with MeJA and water (control) and measured responses over three consecutive years. We observed the treatment effects on variables associated with herbivory, growth, and reproduction in the MeJA-treated and untreated ramet and neighboring ramets distanced from 10 to 500cm. MeJA-treated ramets had fewer grazed leaves and browsed shoots compared to control, with higher effects in 2014 and 2015, respectively. In 2013, growth of control ramets was greater than MeJA-treated ramets. However, MeJA-treated ramets had more flowers and berries than control ramets 2years after the treatment. The level of insect and mammalian herbivory was also lower in untreated neighboring ramets distanced 10-150cm and, consistent with responses of MeJA-treated ramets, the stronger effect was also one and 2years delayed, respectively. The same neighboring ramets had fewer flowers and berries than untreated ramets, indicating a trade-off between defense and reproduction. Although plant-plant effects were observed across all years, the strength varied by the distance between the MeJA-treated ramets and its untreated neighbors. We document that induced defense in bilberry reduces both insect and mammalian herbivory, as well as growth, over multiple seasons. The defense responses occurred in a delayed manner with strongest effects one and 2years after the induction. Additionally, our results indicate defense signaling between MeJA-treated ramets and untreated neighbors. In summary, this study shows that induced defenses are important ecological strategies not only for the induced individual plant but also for neighboring plants across multiple years in boreal forests.";"bilberry; boreal forest; delayed response; methyl jasmonate; multiannual effects; plant-plant interactions; Vaccinium myrtillus";2018;"ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION";"Ecology; Evolutionary Biology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

However, there is currently a lack of knowledge pertaining to those factors affecting small game flush rates. In an effort to address this paucity of information, we investigated factors that may affect flush rates of 3 small game species: ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus; hereafter, grouse), northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; hereafter, bobwhite), and rabbit (Sylvilagus spp.). From 2003 to 2015, we collected cooperator hunting logs for 3,948 grouse hunts, 19,301 rabbit hunts, and 4,798 bobwhite hunts in Kentucky, USA. Hunting success was defined as the number of grouse, rabbit, or bobwhite coveys flushed by a hunting party. We used an information theoretic approach to model variables that may explain variation in hunting success. The number of hunters within a party explained the greatest amount of variation in hunting success for all species, with a positive relationship between the number of hunters and success. Similarly, for grouse and rabbit, we observed a positive relationship between the number of dogs in a party and hunting success. Weather variables and annual abundance indices were not supported in any competing models explaining hunting success, suggesting a possible scale mismatch related to these broad-scale data and more localized conditions experienced by hunting parties. Our research indicates that increasing hunting party size through the addition of hunters and dogs was a unifying influence on increasing hunting success (likely through increased hunting corridors) across small game species. This information can be useful for agencies seeking to increase or maintain support for small game hunters in the future.

Gossypol, a secondary plant metabolite found in cotton (Gossypium spp.), is known to be toxic to a variety of animals, specifically monogastric mammals and birds. However, there are no published data regarding the effects of gossypol in northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus). Our goal was to determine whether ingestion of gossypol presents a threat to northern bobwhite survival and reproduction. We performed this study at Tarleton State University Northern Bobwhite Research Center (Stephenville, TX, USA) during March and April 2016, using the Environmental Protection Agency's 850.2100 Guideline: Avian Acute Oral Toxicity Test. We administered one-time doses of refined gossypol to northern bobwhites at 20 mg/kg, 200 mg/ kg, 262 mg/kg, 342 mg/kg, 447 mg/kg, 585 mg/kg, 765 mg/kg, and 1,000 mg/kg body weight (BW) and observed them daily throughout a 14-day period. We measured feed consumption daily and body mass weekly. Birds receiving larger doses (447-1,000 mg/kg BW) consumed less total feed postdosing (55.46 +/- 56.46 g, n = 39) and had greater, negative postdosing percent change in mass (-23.02 +/- 13.04%, n = 85) compared with control birds and those receiving lower doses (20-342 mg/kg BW). We also examined laying performance and egg quality of birds dosed with 20 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg BW (n = 30 pairs) and the growth rate and percent mortality of second-generation young produced from these pairs. There was no difference in laying performance, egg quality, the percentage of chicks that hatched, and the growth rate and percent mortality of chicks between the dosing rates. Our results suggest that gossypol can have adverse effects on feed consumption and body mass in northern bobwhites at sufficient doses; however, a one-time acute dose of gossypol up to 200 mg/kg BW does not pose any negative reproductive effects.

In areas with low population densities, traditional trapping techniques such as drop-netting and spotlighting have been largely ineffective. To increase trapping efficiency in such situations, we developed a new method to capture greater sage-grouse in Wyoming, USA, during spring and autumn 2008-2011. We captured 92 sage-grouse (30 adult females, 57 yearling females, 3 hatch-year females, and 2 adult males) using a CODA net launcher modified to mount on a front receiver of a truck or all-terrain vehicle. We had 71% success (82 successful captures of >= 1 grouse in 115 attempts). We captured grouse during spring on the periphery of leks, to reduce disturbance of lekking behavior, and during autumn along gravel roads. Capture mortality was <1.0%. We recorded low mortality (4.6%) up to 2 weeks postcapture that may have been attributed to capture and handling stress. This technique proved effective at capturing greater sage-grouse and we believe this method can be effective at capturing other lekking species of prairie grouse with similar behavioral traits.

To better understand the role of thyroid hormones in avian development, we examined autonomic control of heart rate and blood pressure while manipulating thyroid hormone levels in the late stage embryonic Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos domestica). Thyroid hormone levels were manipulated on day 24 of a 28-day incubation period with the thyroperoxidase inhibitor methimazole (MMI), triiodothyronine (T-3), or saline. On day 25 of incubation, autonomic tone on cardiovascular function was studied by injections of cholinergic and adrenergic receptor antagonists. Embryos from all treatment groups expressed a cholinergic and beta-adrenergic tone on heart rate at this age. Cholinergic blockade with atropine produced a larger change in heart rate in the hyperthyroid animals compared with euthyroid animals. In response to beta-adrenergic blockade, hyperthyroid conditions produced a larger decrease in heart rate compared with euthyroid animals, with no change in mean arterial blood pressure. In response to alpha-adrenergic blockade, mean arterial blood pressure decreased in the euthyroid animals and more developed hyperthyroid animals.

We used breeding habitat metrics, landscape attributes, and indices of grouse abundance, to compare fit between structural connectivity and genetic differentiation within five long-established Sage-Grouse Management Zones (MZ) I-V using microsatellite genotypes from 6,844 greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) collected across their 10.7million-km(2) range. We estimated structural connectivity using a circuit theory-based approach where we built resistance surfaces using thresholds dividing the landscape into habitat and nonhabitat and nodes were clusters of sage-grouse leks (where feather samples were collected using noninvasive techniques). As hypothesized, MZ-specific habitat metrics were the best predictors of differentiation. To our surprise, inclusion of grouse abundance-corrected indices did not greatly improve model fit in most MZs. Functional connectivity of breeding habitat was reduced when probability of lek occurrence dropped below 0.25 (MZs I, IV) and 0.5 (II), thresholds lower than those previously identified as required for the formation of breeding leks, which suggests that individuals are willing to travel through undesirable habitat. The individual MZ landscape results suggested terrain roughness and steepness shaped functional connectivity across all MZs. Across respective MZs, sagebrush availability (<10%-30%; II, IV, V), tree canopy cover (>10%; I, II, IV), and cultivation (>25%; I, II, IV, V) each reduced movement beyond their respective thresholds. Model validations confirmed variation in predictive ability across MZs with top resistance surfaces better predicting gene flow than geographic distance alone, especially in cases of low and high differentiation among lek groups. The resultant resistance maps we produced spatially depict the strength and redundancy of range-wide gene flow and can help direct conservation actions to maintain and restore functional connectivity for sage-grouse.";"dispersal; gene flow; genetic differentiation; genetic diversity; habitat selection models; isolation by resistance; landscape resistance";2018;"EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS";"Evolutionary Biology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Game bird management has the potential to benefit conservation, as management practices specifically targeted at reducing the factors limiting game populations may have positive effects on non-game species. However, such management may also have costs to species. 2. We review the literature that examines the effect of different forms of game bird management on non-target species in Europe, including habitat management, predator control, parasite control, provision of water and food and rear and release. We focus on Europe, where these forms of management are common and sometimes intensive. 3. We identified 35 studies, which recorded 122 individual significant effects. Most studies (80%) focussed on the effects of habitat management and predator control, and >90% were carried out in the UK. 4. 63% of the 122 significant effects on non-game species were positive. Overall, 85% of the effects of habitat management in agricultural habitats were positive, while in non-agricultural habitats 65% of effects were negative. Effects of rear and release were mixed (8 positive and 7 negative). Legal predator control was almost always positive (96% of effects), or benign, whereas illegal predator control was always negative (8 effects). This continues to be a major cost to conservation. No studies examined the effects of parasite control on non-target wildlife. Three of four significant effects of supplementary feeding were negative. 5. More studies are needed on the impacts of game bird management on non-game species, and particularly of rear and release, the provision of supplementary food and water, and parasite control. We also found few experimental studies examining the specific effects of management for shooting of game birds, and very few studies overall outside the UK.

The Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) is a large sexually dimorphic tetraonid that is endemic to the sagebrush biome of western North America. The impacts of oil and gas (OAG) development at individual leks has been well-documented. However, no previous studies have quantified the population-level response. Methods: Hierarchical models were used to estimate the effects of the areal disturbance due to well pads as well as climatic variation on individual lek counts and Greater sage-grouse populations (management units) over 32 years. The lek counts were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models while the management units were analyzed using Gompertz population dynamic models. The models were fitted using frequentist and Bayesian methods. An information-theoretic approach was used to identify the most important spatial scale and time lags. The relative importance of OAG and climate at the local and population-level scales was assessed using information-theoretic (Akaike's weights) and estimation (effect size) statistics. Results: At the local scale, OAG was an important negative predictor of the lek count. At the population scale, there was only weak support for OAG as a predictor of density changes but the estimated impacts on the long-term carrying capacity were consistent with summation of the local impacts. Regional climatic variation, as indexed by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, was an important positive predictor of density changes at both the local and population level (particularly in the most recent part of the time series). Conclusions: Additional studies to reduce the uncertainty in the range of possible effects of OAG at the population scale are required.

To define the stimulus with the highest priority at each moment, a network of reciprocal connections between the TeO and the isthmi promotes competition between concurrent tectal inputs. In the avian midbrain, the neurons mediating enhancement and suppression of tectal inputs are located in separate isthmic nuclei, facilitating the analysis of the neural processes that mediate competition. A specific subset of radial neurons in the intermediate tectal layers relay retinal inputs to the isthmi, but at present it is unclear whether separate neurons innervate individual nuclei or a single neural type sends a common input to several of them. In this study, we used in vitro neural tracing and cell-filling experiments in chickens to show that single neurons innervate, via axon collaterals, the three nuclei that comprise the isthmotectal network. This demonstrates that the input signals representing the strength of the incoming stimuli are simultaneously relayed to the mechanisms promoting both enhancement and suppression of the input signals. By performing in vivo recordings in anesthetized chicks, we also show that this common input generates synchrony between both antagonistic mechanisms, demonstrating that activity enhancement and suppression are closely coordinated. From a computational point of view, these results suggest that these tectal neurons constitute integrative nodes that combine inputs from different sources to drive in parallel several concurrent neural processes, each performing complementary functions within the network through different firing patterns and connectivity.";"optic tectum; vision; spatial attention; stimulus selection; isthmi";2018;"PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA";"Multidisciplinary Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

High environmental temperature causes deleterious impacts on physiology and immunology of poultry and impairs their productivity. Heat stress is linked to compromised productivity through a decline in growth rate, feed utilization, blood biochemistry and immunity. In addition, heat stress induced adverse effects on mineral balance of birds and the extent of such effects depended on the type of mineral and the severity of heat stress. Exposure of broilers to high temperature adversely affects mineral metabolism and their excretion route and reduced the retention of some minerals like P, Na, K, S, Mg, Mn, Zn and Cu. On the other hand, the effect of climate on intestinal microbiota has been described in a number of studies. Where, exposure to heat stress can also increase the colonization of Salmonella in the intestine and increase the susceptibility of birds to E. coif and change ileal contents. It is also characterized by decreased antioxidant enzymes in poultry species, resulting in increased oxidative stress that means presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in excess of the available antioxidant capacity of animal cells. However, further studies are still required to increase the information and knowledge of basic mechanisms associated with the consequences of heat stress on poultry. This article focuses on the scientific evidence available on the negative role of heat stress on physiological responses, biochemical blood parameters, immunity, antioxidant, mineral balance, acid-base balance, osmoregulation, body and rectal temperature, intestinal and ileal microbiota as well as the parameters related to thyroid, liver and kidney functions in some poultry species.";"Heat stress; Antioxidant; Immunity; Physiology; Microbiota; Mineral excretion; Hormones; Poultry";2018;"JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY";"Biology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Here, we investigated whether the fractal dimension (FD) of a complex plumage pattern displayed by red-legged partridges Alectoris rufa could function as a potential sexual signal. We captured wild birds early in the breeding season and tested if mated and unmated birds differed in the FD of their conspicuous melanin-based black bib. We also tested if the FD of the black bib was correlated within the pair, looking for evidence of assortative mating based on the expression of this trait. We simultaneously assessed similar effects in other ornamental traits (black bib size, white throat patch and black flank band surface, redness of the eye rings and bill). Mated birds showed higher black bib FD values than unmated ones. Mated males, but not females, also displayed a larger black bib. Moreover, the black bib FD (but not the trait size) and the white throat patch surface showed assortative mating.

Effects on prolactin (PRL) and ovarian steroids in chickens housed under different temperatures were also elucidated. Sixty female chickens were divided into four groups. Groups 1, 2, and 3 were reared under controlled temperatures of 33 +/- 2 degrees C, 31 +/- 2 degrees C, and 27 +/- 2 degrees C, respectively. Group 4 was reared under an uncontrolled natural temperature (approximately 27 degrees C). Blood samples were collected from each chicken once a week for 11 weeks, and plasma PRL, oestradiol (E), progesterone (P), and testosterone (T) levels were determined utilising enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The results revealed that E levels were significantly higher in chickens reared under low ambient temperature (27 degrees C) when compared with those exposed to 31 degrees C and 35 degrees C. No significant differences in PRL, P, and T levels were observed. Egg quality was affected by high ambient temperature. Eggshell thickness of chickens housed at 35 degrees C was thinner than those of other groups. These results indicate that changes in ambient temperature affect circulating levels of E but not PRL, P, and T. Thermally-stressed environments with high temperatures therefore impact egg quality in the native Thai chicken by reducing eggshell thickness.";"egg quality; native Thai chicken; prolactin; steroid hormone; temperature";2018;"AVIAN BIOLOGY RESEARCH";"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Ornithology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We investigated long-term plant community responses to wildfire in a 7000-km(2) ecotone between mixed-grass prairie and sagebrush steppe ecosystems, which have dramatically different historical fire regimes. We asked whether plant community responses to wildfire in the ecotone were more similar to mixed-grass prairie, sagebrush steppe, or a hybrid of these two. We sampled plant community composition at 70 pairs of transects located inside and outside of wildfires that burned from 1937 to 2012. We determined whether (1) wildfires predicted plant community composition, (2) plant community response to fire varied based on abiotic factors, and (3) effects of wildfire varied based on time since fire. Plant community responses to wildfire did not vary substantially across the study region, despite continuous plant community variation in response to abiotic factors. Overstory responses were characteristic of sagebrush steppe. Burned transects had <10% as much big sagebrush cover as unburned transects, and cover did not increase with time since fire. In contrast, understory plant community responses to fire were similar to mixed-grass prairie. Burned sites had high forb cover in the short term and perennial grass cover in the long term. Within an ecotone, different components of the plant community can maintain functional fidelity to their home ecosystems, despite being spatially juxtaposed.

Forty (62.5%) of the 64 nests that we monitored were successful. Successful nest sites had greater tree cover, increased cover and density of shrubs, and more low-lying shrub cover (1.0 m in height) than unsuccessful nest-sites. Forward elimination stepwise logistic regression was worked out with the above significantly different variables and their first-order interaction as independent variables. Finally, regression equation with the lower Akaike's Information Criterion for small sample sizes (AICc) value was regarded as the optimal model. The model indicated that nest-site success of brown-eared pheasants was negatively related to cover of shrubs, and first-order interaction between cover of trees and cover of shrub at a height of 1.0 m, suggesting bigger cover of shrubs, cover of trees and cover of shrub at height of 1.0 m were the best predictors of nest success from a diverse predator community. In addition, brown-eared pheasants have a preference for rock-cavities. Therefore, based on nest-site selection of this eared pheasant, we strongly suggest that moderate logging activity and prohibition of local peoples' firewood collection in the core areas may provide some optimal nest habitat for the brown-eared pheasant.";"Brown-eared pheasants; Crossoptilon mantchuricum; Huanglong mountains; Logistic regression; Nest-sites";2018;"PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY";"Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Coral tissue loss amounted to 95% across the Archipelago. Also at that time, all coral reefs in the central and southern islands disappeared following severe degradation and eventual collapse due primarily to intense bioerosion and low recruitment. Six sites in the southern islands have demonstrated low to moderate coral community (scattered colonies, but no carbonate framework) recovery. The iconic pocilloporid reef at Devil's Crown (Floreana Island) experienced recovery to 2007, then severe mortality during a La Nina cooling event, and is again (as of 2017) undergoing rapid recovery. Notable recovery has occurred at the central (Marchena) and northern islands (Darwin and Wolf). Of the 17 structural reefs first observed in the mid-1970s, the single surviving reef (Wellington Reef) at Darwin Island remains in a positive growth mode. The remainder either degraded to a coral community or was lost. Retrospective analyses of the age structure of corals killed in 1983, and isotopic signatures of the skeletal growth record of massive corals suggest the occurrence of robust coral populations during at least a 500-year period before 1983. The greatest potential threats to the recovery and persistence of coral reefs include: ocean warming and acidification, bioerosion, coral diseases, human population growth (increasing numbers of residents and tourists), overfishing, invasive species, pollution, and habitat destruction.

Qualitative and quantitative similarities in different species suggest the existence of a shared system (approximate number system). Biases associated with sensory properties are informative about the underlying mechanisms. In humans, regular spacing increases perceived numerosity (regular-random numerosity illusion). This has led to a model that predicts numerosity based on occupancy (a measure that decreases when elements are close together). We used a procedure in which observers selected one of two stimuli and were given feedback with respect to whether the choice was correct. One configuration had 20 elements and the other 40, randomly placed inside a circular region. Participants had to discover the rule based on feedback. Because density and clustering covaried with numerosity, different dimensions could be used. After reaching a criterion, test trials presented two types of configurations with 30 elements. One type had a larger interelement distance than the other (high or low clustering). If observers had adopted a numerosity strategy. they would choose low clustering (if reinforced with 40) and high clustering (if reinforced with 20). A clustering or density strategy predicts the opposite. Human adults used a numerosity strategy. Chicks were tested using a similar procedure. There were two behavioral measures: first approach response and final circumnavigation (walking behind the screen). The prediction based on numerosity was confirmed by the first approach data.

Ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) are a widely distributed and common game species in North America that have experienced population declines along their southern range margins, including portions of New England, primarily in response to forest succession and habitat loss. In the state of Maine, ruffed grouse are generally considered abundant, but there is a lack of state-specific knowledge of ruffed grouse survival and harvest rates to inform harvest management. We estimated seasonal and annual survival rates, harvest rates, and documented cause-specific mortality of 248 radio-marked ruffed grouse at 2 study areas in central Maine from 2014 to 2016. We used Program MARK to evaluate sources of spatial, temporal, and individual variation that may affect ruffed grouse survival and harvest. Survival was lowest during October and during winter, and adult ruffed grouse had a higher survival probability than juveniles throughout the year with mean annual survival probabilities of 0.280.01 (SE) and 0.13 +/- 0.003, respectively. Harvest rates were greater in a state-owned Wildlife Management Area and were lower within commercially managed private forest that was open to public hunting. Harvest results suggest harvest (H) was greatest at the beginning of the hunting season (Oct; Frye Mountain H-Oct=0.14 +/- 0.02; Stud Mill H-Oct=0.07 +/- 0.02), and was lower later in the season (Nov and Dec; Frye Mountain HNov-Dec=0.07 +/- 0.02; Stud Mill HNov-Dec=0.03 +/- 0.01). Pooled across all years and study areas, the ruffed grouse harvest rate was 0.16 (95% CI=0.14-0.18). Our results are comparable to other range-wide studies and suggest that current hunting regulations for ruffed grouse in Maine are consistent with sustainable population management.

A selective review with focus on chickens";"Domestication of animals offers unique possibilities to study evolutionary changes caused by similar selection pressures across a range of species. Animals from separate genera tend to develop a suite of phenotypic alterations referred to as ""the domesticated phenotype"". This involves changes in appearance, including loss of pigmentation, and alterations in body size and proportions. Furthermore, effects on reproduction and behaviour are typical. It is hypothesized that this recurring phenotype may be secondary effects of the increased tameness that is an inevitable first step in the domestication of any species. We first provide a general overview of observations and experiments from different species and then review in more detail a project attempting to recreate the initial domestication of chickens. Starting from an outbred population of Red Junglefowl, ancestors of all modem chickens, divergent lines were selected based on scores in a standardized fear-of-human test applied to all birds at 12 weeks of age. Up to the eighth selected generation, observations have been made on correlated effects of this selection on various phenotypes. The fear score had a significant heritability and was genetically correlated to several other behavioural traits. Furthermore, low-fear birds were larger at hatch, grew faster, laid larger eggs, had a modified metabolism and increased feed efficiency, had modified social behaviour and reduced brain size. Selection affected gene expression and DNA-methylation in the brains, but the genetic and epigenetic effects were not specifically associated with stress pathways. Further research should be focused on unraveling the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying the correlated side-effects of reduced fear of humans.";"Genetics; Epigenetics; Domestication; Red junglefowl";2018;"APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE";"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Behavioral Sciences; Veterinary Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

In this experiment, we added 40 and 400 mg/kg GEN to the diet of laying broiler breeder hens to clarify the maternal effects of GEN on the development and metabolism of chick embryos. GEN treatment at 40 mg/kg increased embryonic length, weight, and liver index, as well as the width of the proliferative zone in the tibial growth plate of chick embryos. Gene ontology (GO) cluster analysis of the hepatic transcriptome showed that GEN treatment promoted embryonic development and cell proliferation. Low-dose GEN treatment increased insulin growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)3 mRNA expression in the embryonic liver, whereas high-dose GEN treatment increased IGFBP5 expression and activated the apoptosis and protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. Furthermore, adding supplemental GEN to the diet of hens promoted the glycolysis process in the embryonic liver through the insulin-signaling pathway, upregulated target genes (phosphoglucomutase-2, hexokinase 1, dihydroxyacetone phosphate by aldolase, phosphofructokinase, platelet, and enolase 2), and enhanced the transport of carboxylic acids and cholesterol and the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acid (arachidonic acid) in the embryonic liver through upregulation of liver X receptor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, and patatin-like phospholipase A. Additionally, GEN treatment increased fatty acid -oxidation and Na+/K+-ATPase activity in the embryonic liver through activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs; PPAR and PPAR) and the AMPK signaling pathway, which could provide energy for embryonic development. In addition, GEN treatment in hens increased superoxide dismutase activity and metallothionein expression in the chick embryonic liver and promoted lymphocyte proliferation through upregulation of mRNA expression of CDKN1A, IL12RB1, Sox11, PRKAR1A, PRKCQ, and TCF3. The improved immunity and antioxidant capacity, as a result of maternal GEN effects, was conducive to embryonic development. In summary, the addition of GEN to the diet of laying broiler breeder hens significantly promoted the development and metabolism of chick embryos.Lv, Z., Fan, H., Zhang, B., Ning, C., Xing, K., Guo, Y.

Although Eimeria spp. are considered to have a negative impact on Japanese rock ptarmigan populations, the ecological interactions between the parasites and their hosts have not yet been fully clarified. We therefore conducted seasonal surveys of the prevalence of Eimeria spp. in Japanese rock ptarmigan populations. In addition, we recorded the ambient temperature in ptarmigan habitat and characterized the ability of eimerian isolates to acquire infectivity. Eimeria spp. were detected in 217 of 520 (41.7%) Japanese rock ptarmigan fecal samples in 2006 and in 177 of 308 (57.5%) fecal samples in 2007.

In adult birds and chicks, infection rates increased towards August (summer) and then decreased as the temperature decreased toward November (winter). Oocyst counts per gram (OPG) of feces peaked in August in adults and chicks, and OPG values were markedly higher in chicks than in adults. Isolated Eimeria spp. oocysts sporulated at temperatures as low as 8 degrees C and remained viable after being stored at 4 degrees C for 6 months.

This constitutes wastage, raising economic, environmental and ethical questions. We review what is known of the fates of released pheasants and consider why they do not directly contribute to the numbers harvested. We focus on four main explanations: predation, disease, starvation and dispersal, and highlight other important causes of mortality. For each explanation, we attempt to attribute levels of loss and identify timings or conditions when such losses may be heaviest. We review factors that exacerbate losses and methods available to mitigate them. Opportunities for amelioration may arise at all stages of the rearing and release of pheasants and involve changes to the conditions under which eggs are produced, the way young pheasants are reared or the management of the environment into which they are released. We found few studies investigating impacts of post-release management techniques on pheasant survival outside of the breeding season within a UK context. We found that a number of less commonly deployed practices focusing on early-life, pre-release management may improve survival. Given the scale of pheasant releasing in the UK, even improvements in survival of 1% would mean that similar to 350,000 fewer birds die of natural causes. Complementing current post-release management with proven novel pre-release management interventions could reduce the number of pheasants required for release, whilst maintaining current shooting levels.

In vertebrates, RFamide peptides make a family and consist of the groups of gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH), neuropeptide FF (NPFF), prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP), kisspeptin (kiss1 and kiss2), and pyroglutamylated RFamide peptide/26RFamide peptide (QRFP/26RFa). It now appears that these vertebrate RFamide peptides exert important neuroendocrine, behavioral, sensory, and autonomic functions. In 2000, GnIH was discovered as a novel hypothalamic RFamide peptide inhibiting gonadotropin release in quail. Subsequent studies have demonstrated that GnIH acts on the brain and pituitary to modulate reproductive physiology and behavior across vertebrates. To clarify the origin and evolution of GnIH, the existence of GnIH was investigated in agnathans, the most ancient lineage of vertebrates, and basal chordates, such as tunicates and cephalochordates (represented by amphioxus). This review first summarizes the structure and function of GnIH and other RFamide peptides, in particular NPFF having a similar C-terminal structure of GnIH, in vertebrates.

However, at Felsenthal National Wildlife Refuge, Crossett, Arkansas, USA, the bobwhite population was not increasing despite the availability of seemingly suitable habitat from management for the endangered species.

The Pan-European boreal forest history gradient as an ""experiment""";"There are currently competing demands on Europe's forests and the finite resources and services that they can offer. Forestry intensification that aims at mitigating climate change and biodiversity conservation is one example. Whether or not these two objectives compete can be evaluated by comparative studies of forest landscapes with different histories. We test the hypothesis that indicators of wood production and biodiversity conservation are inversely related in a gradient of long to short forestry intensification histories. Forest management data containing stand age, volume and tree species were used to model the opportunity for wood production and biodiversity conservation in five north European forest regions representing a gradient in landscape history from very long in the West and short in the East. Wood production indicators captured the supply of coniferous wood and total biomass, as well as current accessibility by transport infrastructure. Biodiversity conservation indicators were based on modelling habitat network functionality for focal bird species dependent on different combinations of stand age and tree species composition representing naturally dynamic forests. In each region we randomly sampled 25 individual 100-km(2) areas with contiguous forest cover. Regarding wood production, Sweden's Bergslagen region had the largest areas of coniferous wood, followed by Vitebsk in Belarus and Zemgale in Latvia. NW Russia's case study regions in Pskov and Komi had the lowest values, except for the biomass indicator. The addition of forest accessibility for transportation made the Belarusian and Swedish study region most suitable for wood and biomass production, followed by Latvia and two study regions in NW Russian. Regarding biodiversity conservation, the overall rank among regions was opposite. Mixed and deciduous habitats were functional in Russia, Belarus and Latvia. Old Scots pine and Norway spruce habitats were only functional in Komi. Thus, different regional forest histories provide different challenges in terms of satisfying both wood production and biodiversity conservation objectives in a forest management unit. These regional differences in northern Europe create opportunities for exchanging experiences among different regional contexts about how to achieve both objectives. We discuss this in the context of land-sharing versus land-sparing. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, dermal exposure and toxicity are often unknown for avifauna. The US EPA's Terrestrial Investigation Model (TIM) uses a method to estimate avian dermal LD50 values (and ultimately dermal exposure) that frequently results in unusually high dermal exposure and low dermal LD50 estimates. This is primarily a result of using organophosphate and carbamate toxicity data to develop the oral-dermal relationship. An estimated dermal LD50 is necessary to generate a dermal route equivalency factor that normalizes potency relative to oral toxicity within the dermal pathway dose equation. In this study, atrazine dermal absorption experiments were conducted with mallard, northern bobwhite, and rat skin. These data were used to derive an avian-mammal dermal route equivalency factor for atrazine and introduce a new approach for estimating dermal LD50 values and ultimately predicting exposure via the TIM dermal pathway. Compared to the default TIM method, this new approach yielded TIM output with lower mean total dose, lower dermal fraction of total dose, greater oral fraction of total dose, and reduced model predicted mortality for atrazine. In addition, the new approach was compared with other methods for estimating avian dermal LD50 values such as those proposed for use with mammalian data and physico-chemical properties and a triazine-specific oral dermal equation using mammalian LD50 data. The three alternative approaches resulted in output similar to one another and different from the default TIM methods. These results indicate that a dermal route equivalency factor derived from empirical data provides a higher avian dermal LD50 estimate that is consistent with other methods. In addition, the use of this dermal route equivalency factor results in greatly reduced modeled atrazine risk to birds than previously reported in US EPA risk assessments using TIM.

In this study, the draft genome of YO was assembled using a hybrid de novo assembly method that takes advantage of high-depth Illumina short reads (376.6X) and low-depth Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long reads (9.7X). Findings: The contig and scaffold NG50s of the hybrid de novo assembly were 362.3 Kbp and 16.8 Mbp, respectively. The completeness (97.6%) of the draft genome (Ogye 1.1) was evaluated with single-copy orthologous genes using Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs and found to be comparable to the current chicken reference genome (galGal5; 97.4%; contigs were assembled with high-depth PacBio long reads (50X) and scaffolded with short reads) and superior to other avian genomes (92%-93%; assembled with short read-only or hybrid methods). Compared to galGal4 and galGal5, the draft genome included 551 structural variations including the fibromelanosis (FM) locus duplication, related to hyperpigmentation. To comprehensively reconstruct transcriptome maps, RNA sequencing and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing data were analyzed from 20 tissues, including 4 black tissues (skin, shank, comb, and fascia). The maps included 15,766 protein-coding and 6,900 long noncoding RNA genes, many of which were tissue-specifically expressed and displayed tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns in the promoter regions.

Although there is no standardized guideline, the avian embryo has proven to be particularly promising as it responds sensitively to a number of EDCs preferentially impacting the reproductive axis. In the present study we examined the effects of in ovo exposure to fulvestrant and tamoxifen as antiestrogenic model compounds and co-exposure to both substances and the potent estrogen 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) regarding sex differentiation and embryonic development of the domestic fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus). The substances were injected into the yolk of fertilized eggs on embryonic day 1. On embryonic day 19 sex genotype and phenotype were determined, followed by gross morphological and histological examination of the gonads. Sole EE2-treatment (20 ng/g egg) particularly affected male gonads and resulted in an increased formation of female-like gonadal cortex tissue and a reduction of seminiferous tubules. In ovo exposure to tamoxifen (0.1/1/10 mu/g egg) strongly impaired the differentiation of female gonads, led to a significant size reduction of the left ovary and induced malformations of the ovarian cortex, while fulvestrant (0.1/1/10 mu g/g egg) did not affect sexual differentiation. However, both antiestrogens were able to antagonize the feminizing effects of EE2 in genetic males when administered simultaneously. Since both estrogens and antiestrogens induce concentration-dependent morphological alterations of the sex organs, the chick embryo can be regarded as a promising model for the identification of chemicals with estrogenic and antiestrogenic activity.";"Gonad; Chicken embryo; Estrogen; Fulvestrant; Sex differentiation; Antiestrogen; 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol; Tamoxifen; Endocrine disruption";2018;"PEERJ";"Multidisciplinary Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

In birds, although the role of male ornamentation, plumage coloration, genetic dissimilarity, and body size have on mate selection by females have been examined extensively, few studies have clarified exactly how these characteristics affect female mate preferences. Here, we show that testosterone (T)-dependent male attractiveness enhances female preference for males of a polygamous species, the Japanese quail. A significant positive correlation between female mating preference and circulating Tin the male was observed. The cheek feathers of attractive males contained higher levels of melanin and were more brightly colored. The ability of females to distinguish attractive males from other males was negated when the light source was covered with a sharp cut filter (cutoff; < 640 nm). When females were maintained under short-day conditions, the expression of retinal red-sensitive opsin decreased dramatically and they became insensitive to male attractiveness.

These prenatal maternal effects are often found to be sex-specific and may have evolved as adaptations, maximizing fitness of male and female offspring for their future environment. Female hormone levels during reproduction are considered a potential mechanism regulating sex allocation in vertebrates: high maternal androgens have repeatedly been linked to increased investment in sons, whereas high glucocorticoid levels are usually related to increased investment in daughters. However, results are not consistent across studies and therefore still inconclusive. In Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), we previously found that pair-housed females had higher plasma androgen levels and tended to have higher plasma corticosterone levels than group-housed females. In the current study we investigate whether these differences in maternal social environment and physiology affect offspring sex allocation and physiology. Counter to our expectations, we find no effects of the maternal social environment on offspring sex ratio, sex-specific mortality, growth, circulating androgen or corticosterone levels. Also, maternal corticosterone or androgen levels do not correlate with offspring sex ratio or mortality. The social environment during reproduction therefore does not necessarily modify sex allocation and offspring physiology, even if it causes differences in maternal physiology.

We reviewed evidence for impacts of climate change on Holarctic mountain bird populations in terms of physiology, phenology, trophic interactions, demography and observed and projected distribution shifts, including effects of other factors that interact with climate change. We developed an objective classification of high-elevation, mountain specialist and generalist species, based on the proportion oftheir breeding range occurring in mountain regions. Our review found evidence of responses of mountain bird populations to climate (extreme weather events, temperature, rainfall and snow) and environmental (i.e. land use) change, but we know little about either the underlying mechanisms or the synergistic effects of climate and land use. Long-term studies assessing reproductive success or survival of mountain birds in relation to climate change were rare. Few studies have considered shifts in elevational distribution over time and a meta-analysis did not find a consistent direction in elevation change. A meta-analysis carried out on future projections of distribution shifts suggested that birds whose breeding distributions are largely restricted to mountains are likely to be more negatively impacted than other species. Adaptation responses to climate change rely mostly on managing and extending current protected areas for both species already present, and for expected colonizing species that are losing habitat and climate space at lower elevation. However, developing effective management actions requires an improvement in the current knowledge of mountain species ecology, in the quality of climate data and in understanding the role of interacting factors. Furthermore, the evidence was mostly based on widespread species rather than mountain specialists.

How these ubiquitous changes shape the function of animals in their natural habitat will have profound impacts on survival, and are thus crucial for understanding the functional ecology of locomotion. We first discuss locomotor perturbations, with an emphasis on the duration associated with them. We then address how commonly studied modes of rapid mass changes (e.g. parturition, autotomy, feeding) perturb locomotion by examining the effects of natural and artificial changes in mass on locomotor performance, kinematics, kinetics and muscle function in terrestrial animals, with an emphasis on non-human vertebrates.

We expected that breeding ravens would frequently use anthropogenic structures and that both breeding and nonbreeding ravens would regularly visit primary point-source subsidies (e.g., landfills and transfer stations). Twenty ravens were captured and GPS-tagged between 2012 and 2014. We found that breeding ravens overwhelmingly built nests on anthropogenic structures (96-100%) and subsequently used small portions of the landscape intensively. Movement of nonbreeding ravens (distance average = 2783 m/h) and ravens who had failed nests (distance average = 1357 m/h) ranged widely. Breeding ravens visited highways and railroads inversely proportional to the distance between the nest and the nearest highway/railroad. Nonbreeding ravens regularly visited landfills and transfer stations, but breeding ravens did not (<0.1% of locations). We found that nonbreeding ravens travel widely to utilize primary point-source subsidies, breeding ravens focus on areas near the nest, and ravens with failed nests switch to movement behaviors and space use similar to wide-ranging nonbreeding ravens.

These ornaments are generally studied during peak expression, however their size outside the breeding season may determine ultimate ornament size and costliness, and as such reproductive success. We investigated whether male black grouse Lyrurus tetrix eye comb size was related to age, condition and measures of male dominance before and during the breeding season. Total combined eye comb size began to increase similar to 70 d before the start of the breeding season. Adult males (aged 2 yr old) had consistently larger eye combs than younger males (1 yr old) both before and during the breeding season. Heavier and more dominant adult males (attending the lek more frequently and successfully reproducing) had larger eye combs. For younger males, those that were heavier had larger eye combs. Additionally, males that spent more time on the lek showed increased eye comb size as the breeding season approached. Overall we find that ornament size is positively related to dominance and condition before and during the breeding season. Since dominance is accrued through year-round interactions in many species, the ability to maintain larger signals over prolonged periods, including outside of the breeding season, is likely to be beneficial for adults. For younger males, it is likely that they cannot sustain or are constrained from producing larger eye combs over long periods of time. They therefore prioritise growth of their ornaments later, and according to the amount of time they spend on the lek.";"age; ornament expression; dominance";2018;"JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

In particular, melanin-based traits are known to relate to condition and there is a well-characterized genetic pathway underpinning their expression. However, the mechanisms linking variable trait expression to genetic quality remain unclear. One plausible mechanism is that genetic quality could influence trait expression via differential methylation and differential gene expression. We therefore conducted a pilot study examining DNA methylation at a candidate gene (agouti-related neuropeptide: AgRP) in the black grouse Lyrurus tetrix. We specifically tested whether CpG methylation covaries with age and multilocus heterozygosity (a proxy of genetic quality) and from there whether the expression of a melanin-based ornament (ultraviolet-blue chroma) correlates with DNA methylation. Consistent with expectations, we found clear evidence for age- and heterozygosity-specific patterns of DNA methylation, with two CpG sites showing the greatest DNA methylation in highly heterozygous males at their peak age of reproduction. Furthermore, DNA methylation at three CpG sites was significantly positively correlated with ultraviolet-blue chroma. Ours is the first study to our knowledge to document age- and quality-dependent variation in DNA methylation and to show that dynamic sexual trait expression across the lifespan of an organism is associated with patterns of DNA methylation. Although we cannot demonstrate causality, our work provides empirical support for a mechanism that could potentially link key individual factors to variation in sexual trait expression in a wild vertebrate.";"AgRP; coloration; epigenetics; heterozygosity; melanin; sexual ornament";2018;"ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION";"Ecology; Evolutionary Biology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Little is known about genetic diversity, population structure, and demography of wild Red Junglefowl in their natural habitats. Extinction threats from habitat loss or genetic alteration from domestic introgression exacerbate further the conservation status of this progenitor species. In a previous study, we reported extraordinary adaptive genetic variation in the MHC B-locus in wild Red Junglefowl and no evidence of allelic introgression between wild and domestic chickens was observed. In this study, we characterized spatial genetic variation and population structure in naturally occurring populations of Red Junglefowl in their core distribution range in South Central Vietnam. A sample of 212 Red Junglefowl was obtained from geographically and ecologically diverse habitats across an area of 250x350km. We used amplified fragment-length polymorphism markers obtained from 431 loci to determine whether genetic diversity and population structure varies. We found that Red Junglefowl are widely distributed but form small and isolated populations. Strong spatial genetic patterns occur at both local and regional scales. At local scale, population stratification can be identified to approximately 5km. At regional scale, we identified distinct populations of Red Junglefowl in the southern lowlands, northern highlands, and eastern coastal portions of the study area. Both local and long-distance genetic patterns observed in wild Red Junglefowl may reflect the species' ground-dwelling and territorial characteristics, including dispersal barriers imposed by the Annamite Mountain Range.

Here we investigated the demographic history of the willow grouse (Lagopus lagopus), rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta), and black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) through the Late Pleistocene using two complementary methods and whole genome data. Species distribution modeling (SDM) allowed us to estimate the total range size during the Last Interglacial (LIG) and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) as well as to indicate potential population subdivisions. Pairwise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (PSMC) allowed us to assess fluctuations in effective population size across the same period. Additionally, we used SDM to forecast the effect of future climate change on the three species over the next 50years. We found that SDM predicts the largest range size for the cold-adapted willow grouse and rock ptarmigan during the LGM. PSMC captured intraspecific population dynamics within the last glacial period, such that the willow grouse and rock ptarmigan showed multiple bottlenecks signifying recolonization events following the termination of the LGM. We also see signals of population subdivision during the last glacial period in the black grouse, but more data are needed to strengthen this hypothesis. All three species are likely to experience range contractions under future warming, with the strongest effect on willow grouse and rock ptarmigan due to their limited potential for northward expansion. Overall, by combining these two modeling approaches, we have provided a multifaceted examination of the biogeography of these species and how they have responded to climate change in the past.

Our objectives were to determine if: (1) landscape configuration (i.e., the spatial arrangement of habitat) or composition (i.e., the amount of habitat), at the study.site scale, affected annual survival of females, (2) relationships exist between landscape context (i.e., landscape configuration and composition) and weekly survival to assess effects of landscape composition and configuration on lesser prairie-chicken populations, and (3) anthropogenic features influenced daily mortality risk.

In addition we tested for relationships between weekly survival and landscape configuration or composition within home ranges. Finally, we used Andersen-Gill models to test the influence of distance to anthropogenic features on daily mortality risk. Differences in survival were evident between sites with differing landscape compositions as annual survival in Northwestern Kansas (S=0.27) was half that of Clark County, Kansas (S=0.56), which corresponded with 41.9% more grassland on the landscape in Clark County; landscape configuration did not measurably differ among sites. Survival was greater for prairie-chickens with home-ranges that had greater patch richness and in areas with 30% crop and 57% grassland. Female lesser prairie-chickens also experienced greater mortality risk closer to fences at patch edges.

During the brooding period, rapidly growing Lesser Prairie-Chicken chicks have high calorie demands and are restricted to foods within immediate surroundings. For adults and juveniles during cold winters, meeting thermoregulatory demands with available food items of limited nutrient content may be challenging. Our objective was to determine the primary animal and plant components of Lesser Prairie-Chicken diets among native prairie, cropland, and Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) fields in Kansas and Colorado, USA, during brooding and winter using a DNA metabarcoding approach. Lesser Prairie-Chicken fecal samples (n = 314) were collected during summer 2014 and winter 2014-2015, DNA was extracted, amplified, and sequenced. A region of the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene was sequenced to determine the arthropod component of the diet, and a portion of the trnL intron region was used to determine the plant component. Relying on fecal DNA to quantify dietary composition, as opposed to traditional visual identification of gut contents, revealed a greater proportion of soft-bodied arthropods than previously recorded. Among 80 fecal samples for which threshold arthropod DNA reads were obtained, 35% of the sequences were most likely from Lepidoptera, 26% from Orthoptera, 14% from Araneae, 13% from Hemiptera, and 12% from other orders. Plant sequences from 137 fecal samples were composed of species similar to Ambrosia (27%), followed by species similar to Lactuca or Taraxacum (10%), Medicago (6%), and Triticum (5%). Forbs were the predominant (>50% of reads) plant food consumed during both brood rearing and winter. The importance both of native forbs and of a broad array of arthropods that rely on forbs suggests that disturbance regimes that promote forbs may be crucial in providing food for Lesser Prairie-Chickens in the northern portion of their distribution.";"arthropods; diet; DNA metabarcoding; foraging; forbs; grasslands; grouse; invertebrates; Lesser Prairie-Chicken; Tympanuchus pallidicinctus";2018;"AUK";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

However, the impact of climate change on glacial relict populations is not well understood, and specific recommendations for adaptive conservation management are lacking. We focused on the mountain hare (Lepus timidus) as a model species and modelled species distribution in combination with patch and landscape-based connectivity metrics. They were derived from graph-theory models to quantify changes in species distribution and to estimate the current and future importance of habitat patches for overall population connectivity. Models were calibrated based on 1,046 locations of species presence distributed across three biogeographic regions in the Swiss Alps and extrapolated according to two IPCC scenarios of climate change (RCP 4.5 & 8.5), each represented by three downscaled global climate models. The models predicted an average habitat loss of 35% (22%-55%) by 2100, mainly due to an increase in temperature during the reproductive season. An increase in habitat fragmentation was reflected in a 43% decrease in patch size, a 17% increase in the number of habitat patches and a 34% increase in inter-patch distance. However, the predicted changes in habitat availability and connectivity varied considerably between biogeographic regions: Whereas the greatest habitat losses with an increase in inter-patch distance were predicted at the southern and northern edges of the species' Alpine distribution, the greatest increase in patch number and decrease in patch size is expected in the central Swiss Alps. Finally, both the number of isolated habitat patches and the number of patches crucial for maintaining the habitat network increased under the different variants of climate change.

This balance is particularly true for gallinaceous birds, such as the northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), which are ground foragers and are often exposed to increased predation risk compared to arboreal foragers. We studied how bobwhites might mitigate the threat of human hunting pressure by altering their foraging strategy. We directly monitored hunting encounters with bobwhites, during October 2014-March 2015, and collected daily movement paths (n=514) using radio-telemetry. We performed first-passage time analysis to infer foraging behavior by calculating bout frequency, area, duration, and timing. We found bobwhites mitigated exposure to human hunters by increasing foraging frequency coupled with a decrease in duration (15.4%) and area (7.1%) in response to hunting pressure. We observed a temporal shift in foraging away from peak hunting hours by 30minutes when birds were recently exposed to a discharged firearm. Our results imply that hunting game species can disrupt timing of foraging and therefore influence allocation to competing activities such as anti-predator vigilance. We propose implementing a dynamic harvest management regime that distributes hunting activity temporally and spatially to mitigate high hunting pressure and reduce behavioral effects on bobwhites. Careful planning of hunting activity should reduce its additive effects on natural mortality while improving hunter satisfaction. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society. Northern bobwhites altered their foraging in response to increased levels of hunting pressure in an intensely managed landscape such that bobwhites increased the frequency of foraging but decreased the duration and area foraged.

We assessed the influence of multiple factors that may affect anti-predator behavior in a commonly harvested game bird, the northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), during October 2013-March 2015 on a private plantation in South Carolina, USA. We monitored bobwhite-hunter interactions during hunting events (n=40) using radio-telemetry and behavioral observations. We investigated bobwhite anti-predator behavior in 2 contexts, choice of evasive tactic and timing of tactic deployment (i.e., level of wariness), using a combination of linear regression and multinomial models in a Bayesian framework. Our results indicate the approach style of the hunter (i.e., pointing dog) and vegetation density affect the evasive tactic used. Dense vegetation at 0.6m above ground height promoted hiding behavior of bobwhites, whereas approaching pointing dogs (i.e., not holding point) promoted flushing. Also, dense vegetation at 0.3m above ground height and previous exposure to a discharged firearm elicited an earlier anti-predator response. Our results imply that bobwhites make context-specific decisions regarding hunter evasion, which may be a result of associative learning. Managers may be able to increase bobwhite-hunter encounters and improve hunter satisfaction by maintaining vegetation structure between 0.6 and 1.3m to promote hiding behavior throughout the hunting season. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society. During hunter interactions, bobwhites held more frequently in dense vegetation 0.6m above ground height, flushed more often when encountered by moving pointing dogs, and exhibited learning behaviors from previous exposure to hunters.

Bobwhites were captured and monitored via radiotelemetry 2-3 times/wk during March-November. Means of vegetation metrics important to bobwhites such as bare ground, traversibility, and forb and subshrub cover were similar between control and treatment units in post-treatment years.

In native Thai chickens, plasma prolactin (PRL) concentrations are associated with maternal behaviors, which are also controlled by the DAergic system. However, the role of MT in conjunction with the roles of DA and PRL on the neuroendocrine regulation of the transition from incubating to rearing behavior has never been studied. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the association of MT, DA, and PRL during the transition from incubating to rearing behavior in native Thai hens. Using an immunohistochemistry technique, the numbers of MT-immunoreactive (-ir) and tyrosine hydroxylase-ir (TH-ir, a DA marker) neurons were compared between incubating hens (INC; n = 6) and hens for which the incubated eggs were replaced with 3 newly hatched chicks for 3 days after 6, 10, and 14 days of incubation (REC; n = 6). Plasma PRL concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results revealed that the numbers of MT-ir neurons within the nucleus supraopticus, pars ventralis (SOv), nucleus preopticus medialis (POM), and nucleus paraventricularis magnocellularis (PVN) increased in the REC hens when compared with those of the INC hens at 3 different time points (at days 9, 13, and 17).

However, the number of TH-ir neurons in the nucleus mamillaris lateralis (ML) only decreased in the REC13 hens when compared with the INC13 hens. The decrease in the numbers of TH-ir neurons within the nI and ML is associated with the decrease in the levels of plasma PRL. This study suggests that the presence of either eggs or chicks is the key factor regulating the MTergic system within the SOv, POM, and PVN and the DAergic system within the nI and ML during the transition from incubating to rearing behavior in native Thai chickens.

Nonphotoperiodic cues can modulate photoperiodic control, particularly the inhibitory process. In previous studies of common starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), (1) restriction of food availability to 8 h after dawn had little effect on testicular maturation but dramatically delayed subsequent regression and (2) lower ambient temperature also had little effect during maturation but delayed regression. Could the effects of food restriction and temperature share a common underlying mechanism? Four groups of starlings were kept on a simulated natural cycle in photoperiod in a 2 x 2 factorial experimental design. Two groups were held under an ambient temperature of 16 degrees C, and the other two were held under 6 degrees C. One of each of these groups had food provided ad lib., and in the other two groups access to food was denied 7 h after dawn. In both the ad lib. food groups and the food-restricted groups, lower temperature had little effect on testicular maturation but delayed subsequent regression and molt. In both the 16 degrees C groups and the 6 degrees C groups, food restriction had no effect on testicular maturation but delayed regression and molt. The daily cycle in body temperature was recorded in all groups when the photoperiod had reached 12L:12D, the photoperiod at which regression is initiated. In both 6 degrees C groups, nighttime body temperature was lower than in the 16 degrees C groups, a characteristic of shorter photoperiods. In the two ad lib. food groups high daytime temperature was maintained until dusk, whereas in the two food-restricted groups body temperature began to decrease after food withdrawal. Thus, both lower temperature and food restriction delayed regression, as if the photoperiod was shorter than it actually was, and both resulted in daily cycles in body temperature that reflected cycles under shorter photoperiods. This implies that the daily cycle in body temperature is possibly a common pathway through which nonphotoperiodic cues may operate.";"starling; testis; annual cycle; body temperature; energy; food; photoperiod; temperature; thyroid";2018;"PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY";"Physiology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Scyphozoan jellyfish, their food and their rich symbiotic fauna in a tropical estuary";"Background. The anthropogenic modification of trophic pathways is seemingly prompting the increase of jellyfish populations at the expense of planktivorous fishes. However, gross generalizations are often made because the most basic aspects of trophic ecology and the diverse interactions of jellyfish with fishes remain poorly described. Here we inquire on the dynamics of food consumption of the medusoid stage of the scyphozoan jellyfish Stomolophus meleagris and characterize the traits and diversity of its symbiotic community. Methods. S. meleagris and their associated fauna were sampled in surface waters between November 2015 and April 2017 in Malaga Bay, an estuarine system at the Colombian Pacific. Stomach contents of medusae were examined and changes in prey composition and abundance over time analysed using a multivariate approach. The associated fauna was identified and the relationship between the size of medusae and the size those organisms tested using least-square fitting procedures. Results. The presence of S. meleagris medusa in surface waters was seasonal. The gut contents analysis revealed that algae, copepods and fish early life stages were the more abundant items, and PERMANOVA analysis showed that the diet differed within the seasons (P-(perm) = 0.001) but not between seasons (P-(perm) = 0.134). The majority of the collected medusae (50.4%) were associated with individuals of 11 symbiotic species, 95.3% of them fishes, 3.1% crustaceans and 1.6% molluscs. Therefore, this study reports 10 previously unknown associations. The bell diameter of S. meleagris was positively related to the body sizes of their symbionts. However, a stronger fit was observed when the size relationship between S. meleagris and the fish Hemicaranx zelotes was modelled. Discussion. The occurrence of S. meleagris was highly seasonal, and the observed patterns of mean body size through the seasons suggested the arrival of adult medusae to the estuary from adjacent waters. The diet of S. meleagris in the study area showed differences with previous reports, chiefly because of the abundance of algae that are seemingly ingested but not digested. The low number of zooplanktonic items in gut contents suggest the contribution of alternative food sources not easily identifiable. The observed changes in the composition of food in the guts probably reflect seasonal changes in the availability of prey items. The regular pattern in the distribution of symbionts among medusae (a single symbiont per host) and the positive host-symbiont size relationship reflects antagonistic intraspecific and interspecific behaviour of the symbiont. This strongly suggest that medusa represent an ""economically defendable resource"" that potentially increases the survival and recruitment of the symbionts to the adult population. We argue that, if this outcome of the symbiotic association can be proven, scyphozoan jellyfish can be regarded as floating nurseries.";"Jellyfish blooms; Feeding ecology; Fisheries; Scyphozoans; Gelatinous zooplankton; Fish recruitment; Symbiosis; Diversity of interactions; Trophic ecology; Estuaries";2018;"PEERJ";"Multidisciplinary Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

In Fennoscandia, changes in climate and human land use are assumed to alter the dynamics of cyclic small rodents (main prey) and lead to increased densities and range expansion of an important generalist predator, the red fox Vulpes vulpes. In order to better understand the role of these potential changes in community structure on an alternative prey species, willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus, we analyzed nine years of population census data from SE Norway to investigate how community interactions affected their population dynamics. The ptarmigan populations showed no declining trend during the study period, and annual variations corresponded with marked periodic small rodent peaks and declines. Population growth and breeding success were highly correlated, and both demographic variables were influenced by an interaction between red fox and small rodents. Red foxes affected ptarmigan negatively only when small rodent abundance was low, which is in accordance with the alternative prey hypothesis. Our results confirm the important role of red fox predation in ptarmigan dynamics, and indicate that if small rodent cycles are disrupted, this may lead to decline in ptarmigan and other alternative prey species due to elevated predation pressure.";NA;2018;"PLOS ONE";"Multidisciplinary Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

However, the way in which source habitats are identified and prioritized can reduce the effectiveness of conservation actions. Although sources and sinks are conceptually defined using both demographic and movement criteria, simplifications are often required in systems with limited data. To assess the conservation outcomes of alternative source metrics and resulting prioritizations, we simulated population dynamics and extinction risk for 3 endangered species. Using empirically based habitat population models, we linked habitat maps with measured site- or habitat-specific demographic conditions, movement abilities, and behaviors. We calculated source-sink metrics over a range of periods of data collection and prioritized consistently high-output sources for conservation. We then tested whether prioritized patches identified the habitats that most affected persistence by removing them and measuring the population response. Conservation decisions based on different source-sink metrics and durations of data collection affected species persistence. Shorter time series obscured the ability of metrics to identify influential habitats, particularly in temporally variable and slowly declining populations. Data-rich source-sink metrics that included both demography and movement information did not always identify the habitats with the greatest influence on extinction risk. In some declining populations, patch abundance better predicted influential habitats for short-term regional persistence. Because source-sink metrics (i.e., births minus deaths; births and immigrations minus deaths and emigration) describe net population conditions and cancel out gross population counts, they may not adequately identify influential habitats in declining populations. For many nonequilibrium populations, new metrics that maintain the counts of individual births, deaths, and movement may provide additional insight into habitats that most influence persistence.";"abundance; Black-capped Vireo; conservation; declining population; Greater Sage-Grouse; habitat prioritization; individual-based model; Ord's kangaroo rat; source-sink dynamics; source-sink metrics";2018;"CONSERVATION BIOLOGY";"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

It is a routine means of reproduction in many invertebrates. However, even though parthenogenesis occurs naturally in even more advanced vertebrates, like birds, it is mostly abortive in nature. In fact, multiple limiting factors, such as delayed and unorganized development as well as unfavorable conditions developing within the unfertilized egg upon incubation, are associated with termination of progressive development of parthenogenetic embryos. In birds, diploid parthenogenesis is automictic and facultative producing only males. However, the mechanisms controlling parthenogenesis in birds are not clearly elucidated. Additionally, it appears from even very recent research that these mechanisms may hinder the normal fertilization process and subsequent embryonic development. For instance, virgin quail and turkey hens exhibiting parthenogenesis have reduced reproductive performance following mating. Also, genetic selection and environmental factors, such as live virus vaccinations, are known to trigger the process of parthenogenesis in birds. Therefore, parthenogenesis has a plausible negative impact on the poultry industry. Hence, a better understanding of parthenogenesis and the mechanisms that control it could benefit commercial poultry production.

Laying performances, mortality, egg quality characteristics and welfare level of birds were measured during the study period. Compared with AI birds, NM birds laid the first egg significantly earlier age, and had significantly lower laying rate, mortality and body weight of hens. NM birds however had significantly higher albumen height, Haugh units and yolk colour. No significant differences were found in other laying performances and egg quality characteristics. Except for the back region of AI females which had better feather cover, the average feather score for most body parts of AI and NM hens was not significantly different. An overall feather score of NM females was significantly lower than that of AI ones. The average feather score for each individual part of the body and an overall average score for roosters remained unchanged between two groups. Additionally, NM birds showed a higher level of fear than AI.

This assumption is violated when animals experience injury, physiological stress, or disorientation during capture and handling that increases their mortality risk following release. Such capture-related effects must be accounted for during analysis, typically by censoring individuals from the survival history, to avoid biasing the resulting survival estimates. We reviewed studies of radio-marked upland game birds to characterize researcher approaches for addressing short-term effects of capture on survival, and used data from a study of Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus) to illustrate an empirical approach for evaluating such effects and identifying time thresholds to censor individuals that die shortly following release. A majority of studies (65%) reported using some form of censoring for mortality that occurred within one to three weeks after release, although only 8% of studies reported an empirical approach to identify a threshold for censorship. We found that Ruffed Grouse mortality was greater from one to six days following release when compared with 7 to 30 days. This threshold, and the proportion of birds censored as a result of it, is consistent with a number of previous studies of radio-marked Ruffed Grouse. We also found that short-term mortality of Ruffed Grouse following release was reduced by checking traps twice each day and by adequately concealing traps. We recommend that future studies of radio-marked birds employ empirical methods for detecting postrelease mortality thresholds, which will allow for reduced bias while minimizing unnecessary censorship of birds that die for reasons unrelated to capture.";"capture effects; galliform; game birds; mortality; radio-telemetry; Ruffed Grouse; survival";2018;"AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY";"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Multiple management options have been proposed to reduce raven numbers or reduce the impacts of predation by ravens on sensitive species. We carried out a longitudinal study to evaluate the effects of experimentally manipulating the reproductive success of territorial ravens on the reproductive performance of their prey on Alcatraz Island across 6 years. Specifically, we employed remote video-monitoring on nests of predator and prey to document the effects of oiling raven eggs, a technique to prevent eggs from hatching, on raven reproduction, and to estimate impacts of raven hatching success on their predation of Black-crowned Night-Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) nests. We used Bayesian multinomial logistic exposure models to estimate night-heron nest and chick survival and account for variation in nest failure across different life stages (i.e., egg versus nestling). We found daily predation rates on night-heron nests (median: 1.71%, 85% CI: 1.15-2.44%) and chicks (median: 0.57%, 85% CI: 0.27-1.03%) were the highest during years when ravens nested successfully.

The greatest probability of survival of night-heron eggs and chicks occurred during years when ravens were present but not nesting on Alcatraz. Our results suggest that manipulation of raven breeding success can influence predation and reproductive performance of their prey. These results also indicate that egg-oiling can be a viable localized method to reduce raven recruitment and possibly aid in the conservation of sensitive avian species.";"Black-crowned Night-Heron; Common Raven; Corvus corax; egg-oiling; Nycticorax nycticorax; predation; reproduction";2018;"AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY";"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Pharmacological inhibition of Wnt signaling in the intermediate hyperpallium apicale (IMHA), which is the caudal area of the telencephalon, blocked the recovery of the sensitive period following T-3 injection. In addition, injection of recombinant Wnt-2b protein into the IMHA helped chicks recover the sensitive period without the injection of T-3.

Ashe Junipers provide habitat for wildlife species of economic (e.g., Odocoileus virginianus [White-tailed deer], Meleagris gallopavo [Wild Turkey]) and conservation concern (e.g., the endangered Setophaga chrysoparia [Golden-cheeked Warbler]); however, the relationship between Ashe Junipers and the federally endangered Vireo atricapilla (Black-capped Vireo) is less clear. Black-capped Vireos breed in early successional shrublands where Ashe Junipers are often able to invade, grow quickly, and shade out the deciduous shrubby vegetation preferred by vireos.

Additionally, reproduction may incur a cost to annual survival, given the physiological stress associated with breeding, and predation risks associated with incubation and brood-rearing. We used radio-telemetry and known-fate modeling to quantify annual survival and identify mortality causes of 54 adult female Meleagris gallopavo ssp. silvestris (Eastern Wild Turkey) tracked during 2002-2004 and 2007-2010 in a population characterized by low productivity in a bottomland hardwood forest in Louisiana. We detected 31 mortalities in which predation was the leading cause (87%), primarily attributed to Canis latrans (Coyote) and Lynx rufus (Bobcat). We estimated an annual survival rate of 0.58 (95% CI = 0.47-0.68) with no evidence of seasonal variation. This level of survival appeared to be sufficient to offset low productivity; the population was considered healthy and stable during the study period. Annual survival rates of females that incubated a nest were lower than reproductively inactive females, although confidence intervals overlapped considerably. The mechanisms underlying survival differences between reproductive classes were not entirely clear because survival of nesting females did not greatly decrease during incubation and brood-rearing seasons relative to non-nesters as would be expected under the hypothesis of increased predation risk during reproduction periods.

Some of these substances even affect the transfer of these compounds in the next generation, but it is less clear how different maternally transmitted compounds interact with each other to shape reproductive resource allocation in their offspring. Here, we found that female Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica) that were exposed to high carotenoid levels during embryonic development transferred lower concentrations of yolk antioxidants to their own eggs later in life. This effect disappeared when both testosterone and carotenoid concentrations were manipulated simultaneously, showing long-term and interactive effects of these maternally derived egg components on a female's own egg composition. Given that exposure to high levels of testosterone during embryo development stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impairs antioxidant defenses, we propose that carotenoids act as in ovo antioxidants in an oxidatively stressful environment (i.e. when levels of testosterone are high) but might have prooxidant properties in an environment where they are not used to counteract an increased production of ROS. In line with this hypothesis, we previously showed that prenatal exposure to increased concentrations of yolk carotenoids leads to a rise of oxidative damage at adulthood, but only when yolk testosterone concentrations were not experimentally increased as well. As a consequence, antioxidants in the body may be used to limit oxidative damage in females exposed to high levels of carotenoids during development (but not in females exposed to increased levels of both carotenoids and testosterone), resulting in lower amounts of antioxidants being available for deposition into eggs. Since prenatal antioxidant exposure is known to influence fitness-related traits, the effect detected in this study might have transgenerational consequences.";"yolk carotenoids; yolk testosterone; maternal effects; parental care; prenatal conditions; egg composition";2018;"BIOLOGY LETTERS";"Biology; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Cropland conversion program principles supported in the pheasant literature include establishment of an initial seeding, a multiyear contract structure, prohibition of mowing during the nesting season, promotion of forbs in seedings, provision of large-block enrollments options, and inclusion of midcontract management. These principles are compatible with the habitat needs of many other grassland bird species. We therefore recommend the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and any future CCPs retain these foundational aspects. Initial plantings of higher diversity seed mixes have become prioritized over time, but we note whatever increase in average habitat quality these standards achieved, it was not enough to prevent widespread pheasant declines following more severe statutory limitations on CRP acreage enrollments beginning in 2008, coupled with long-term declines in other habitat types (e.g., hay, pasture, small grains). When faced with a trade-off, we thus recommend emphasis of enrolled area over quality, provided enrolled herbaceous tracts provide adequate structure (>= 3dm of 100% visual obstruction) and canopy cover components (>5% forbs and >5% bare ground). Efficiencies may also be gained by altering initial seeding rates, offsetting program costs using grazing income, allowing more discretion in the use of midcontract management, and prioritizing enrollments in focus areas. Individual states, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and bird conservation joint ventures should work cooperatively to share data and perform return-on-investment-oriented research at multiple spatial scales concerning the effects of CCPs on pheasants.

Ranking allows scarce resources to be guided toward nodes integral to connectivity. The greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) is a species of conservation concern that breeds on spatially discrete leks that must remain connected by genetic exchange for population persistence. We genotyped 5,950 individuals from 1,200 greater sage-grouse leks distributed across the entire species' geographic range. We found a small-world network composed of 458 nodes connected by 14,481 edges. This network was composed of hubsthat is, nodes facilitating gene flow across the networkand spokesthat is, nodes where connectivity is served by hubs. It is within these hubs that the greatest genetic diversity was housed. Using indices of network centrality, we identified hub nodes of greatest conservation importance. We also identified keystone nodes with elevated centrality despite low local population size. Hub and keystone nodes were found across the entire species' contiguous range, although nodes with elevated importance to network-wide connectivity were found more central: especially in northeastern, central, and southwestern Wyoming and eastern Idaho. Nodes among which genes are most readily exchanged were mostly located in Montana and northern Wyoming, as well as Utah and eastern Nevada. The loss of hub or keystone nodes could lead to the disintegration of the network into smaller, isolated subnetworks. Protecting both hub nodes and keystone nodes will conserve genetic diversity and should maintain network connections to ensure a resilient and viable population over time.

We focused on Wyoming, as the state will play a critical role in the long-term persistence of greater sage-grouse due to its relatively robust populations, widespread sagebrush habitats and innovative, large-scale conservation approaches. Landscapes associated with higher abundance of males on leks were characterized as highly connected, sagebrush-dominated areas with limited energy development. These modeled relationships were used to evaluate spatial and temporal changes in the landscape-scale integrity of areas supporting the majority of the greater sage-grouse populations in Wyoming (i.e. core areas). By assessing relative changes in abundance over time, our models indicated that most of the habitat within core areas (86%) exhibited landscape conditions conducive to supporting medium or large greater sage-grouse populations that were stable or increasing through time. Larger populations were associated with larger, more centrally located core areas. Conversely, core areas supporting relatively small or declining populations were located along range margins in the eastern portion of the state.

Mapping of indirect signs is a frequently applied approach to study habitat use or distribution of grouse species. However, only a few studies addressed avian dropping decay up to now, and no study focused on dropping decay of European grouse species. Consequently, we conducted field surveys and greenhouse trials, studying time spans over which capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) droppings persist and factors influencing the decay rates (i.e., habitat type, small mammal access, and precipitation regime). In the field survey, after an exposure of 98 days, only 6% of droppings (n = 156) decayed completely and most droppings remained nearly unchanged. The decay rate was influenced by microsite conditions (i.e., vegetation and location), with lowest decay rates in areas with little ground vegetation or on tree stubs. Destruents were not found to play a major role in affecting decay rate. The greenhouse trial revealed the impact of precipitation on the decay rate of droppings (n = 400): under high-amount and high-intensity precipitation regime droppings decayed faster compared to low-amount and low-intensity precipitation.

Graded concentrations of each test compound were injected into the air cell of chicken or quail eggs before incubation. Embryos were monitored through development (quail) or hatching (chicken). All PAHs tested caused dose-dependent increases in embryo mortality, but few other effects (e.g., weight changes, deformities) were observed. In chicken, windows of developmental sensitivity were identified between embryonic days 4 and 9 and between embryonic days 20 and 22.

In southwestern Idaho, greater population density in agricultural landscapes appears to be driven in part by reliable and abundant prey populations. However, these potential benefits may be offset if agricultural land use increases pesticide exposure, especially during the sensitive reproduction period. Thus, we investigated the extent to which Burrowing Owls nesting near croplands within the Morley Nelson Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area (NCA), Idaho, were exposed to organophosphate (OP), carbamate (CB), and/or organochlorine (OC) pesticides. We examined plasma cholinesterase activity, OP and CB residues in foot-wash samples, and OCs in soils and whole egg contents collected from owls and their nests along a distance gradient from agricultural fields. We further measured eggshell thickness to assess potential for thinning from OC exposure. There was no inhibition of cholinesterase activities in adult or nestling owls near agriculture, and foot-wash samples from adults tested negative for OP and CB pesticides. The OC p,p'-DDE, a metabolite of DDT, occurred in eggs at 27 of 58 nests, but there was some evidence that concentrations increased with increasing distance from agriculture. Concentrations of p,p'-DDE in eggs were relatively low compared to harmful levels in other avian species, were not correlated with eggshell thickness, and did not appear to reduce nesting success. Neither DDT, its metabolites, nor any other OCs were detected in soil samples from local owl breeding areas. These results indicate that p,p'-DDE, organophosphate, and carbamate exposure were not causing toxicity or reproductive impairment of Burrowing Owls in the NCA during our study years.";"Burrowing Owl; Athene cunicularia; cholinesterase; DDT; eggshell thickness; Idaho; insecticide; pesticide; p,p'-DDE";2018;"JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The inclusion of RJM in quail diets significantly decreased the egg production, fertility and hatchability percentages and resulted in a high mortality rate. While heat treated jatropha meal [JH(24) or JH(48)] improved such undesirable effects. The levels of hepatic proteins related to lipid synthesis, cholesterol metabolism and those related to lipid synthesis and transporting to egg yolk were increased in JH(24) and JH(48) groups than RJM group. Hepatic contents of vitellogenin [VGT-II] and estrogen receptor alpha [ER alpha] and circulating estradiol [E2] were improved in JH(48) than RJM and JH(24) groups however still under the control values. On the other hand, estrogen receptor beta [ER beta] were restored to normal control value in both JH(24) and JH(48) groups. Histopathological investigation revealed that RJM produced various alterations in the histoarchitecture of liver, ovary and oviducts but these alterations were reduced in both JH(24) and JH(48) groups. From the obtained data we concluded that heating of jatropha meal for 24 h improved its nutritive value and increasing the time of heating is preferable for reduction of the most of toxic impacts indicating that heat treatment can convert toxic jatropha meal to an alternative protein source for livestock feed in a cheap and clean way without combining any other types of treatments.

Our in vivo and in vitro studies showed that ACSF1-3 genes were extensively expressed, and their expression levels changed dynamically in the liver among different development stages. Moreover, ACSF1 expression was upregulated and ACSF2 expression was downregulated by estrogen, but ACSF3 showed no response to estrogen treatment. The regulatory effect of estrogen on ACSF1 expression was mediated via ERa. The ACSF2 was highly expressed in the liver in peak-laying hens compared with pre-laying and late-laying hens, and also highly expressed in the liver continued egg-laying hens compared with inactive egg-laying hens. It is suggested that hepatic ACSF2 expression level might relate to egg-laying performance in chicken.

Due to their small body size, weasels are vulnerable to attacks by a range of different predators; thus cryptic coat colour may increase their winter survival. By analysing trapping data, we found that the share of white subspecies in the weasel population inhabiting Bialowieza Forest decreases with decreasing numbers of days with snow cover. This led us to hypothesise that selective predation pressure should favour one of the two phenotypes, according to the prevailing weather conditions in winter. A simple field experiment with weasel models (white and brown), exposed against different background colours, revealed that contrasting models faced significantly higher detection by predators.

The endangered Green Peafowl (Pavo muticus) has experienced sharp population declines and distribution range diminishing both in China and Southeast Asia. Field population surveys have not been conducted in China since the 1990s, which hindered conservation planning and decision-making. Methods: With interview and line transects methods, we figured out the population and distribution changes of Green Peafowl across its historical ranges over the past three decades in China during 2014-2017. Results: The Green Peafowl once habituated in 54 counties in China. Nearly 60% of the distribution counties were lost in the past three decades, with the left 22 counties distributed in central, southern and western Yunnan, SW China. Population decrease detected in all distribution areas except for Shuangbai and Xinping county where more than 60% of the total population is located. Only about 30% of the former bird population were recorded with the same interviewing method as 20 years ago.

Fire has the potential to affect the physicochemical and ecological status of water systems, alter several aspects of the carbon cycle (e.g. above- and below-ground carbon storage) and trigger changes in vegetation type and structure. Globally, fire is an essential part of land management in fire-prone regions in, e.g. Australia, the USA and some Mediterranean countries to mitigate the likelihood of catastrophic wildfires and sustain healthy ecosystems. In the less-fire prone UK, fire has a long history of usage in management for enhancing the productivity of heather, red grouse and sheep. This distinctly different socioeconomic tradition of burning underlies some of the controversy in recent decades in the UK around the use of fire. Negative public opinion and opposition from popular media have highlighted concerns around the detrimental impacts burning can have on the health and diversity of upland habitats. It is evident there are many gaps in the current knowledge around the environmental impacts of prescribed burning in less fire-prone regions (e.g. UK). Land owners and managers require a greater level of certainty on the advantages and disadvantages of prescribed burning in comparison to other techniques to better inform management practices. This paper addresses this gap by providing a critical review of published work and future research directions related to the impacts of prescribed fire on three key aspects of ecosystem services: (i) water quality, (ii) carbon dynamics and (iii) habitat composition and structure (biodiversity). Its overall aims are to provide guidance based on the current state-of-the-art for researchers, land owners, managers and policy makers on the potential effects of the use of burning and to inform the wider debate about the place of fire in modern conservation and land management in humid temperate ecosystems.

However, most of the biological questions concerning genomics, phylogenetics, and genetics of some important economic traits have not been answered. It is thus necessary to complete a high-quality genome sequence as well as a series of comparative genomics, evolution, and functional studies. Results: Here, we present a quail genome assembly spanning 1.04 Gb with 86.63% of sequences anchored to 30 chromosomes (28 autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes Z/W). Our genomic data have resolved the long-term debate of phylogeny among Perdicinae (Japanese quail), Meleagridinae (turkey), and Phasianinae (chicken). Comparative genomics and functional genomic data found that four candidate genes involved in early maturation had experienced positive selection, and one of them encodes follicle stimulating hormone beta (FSH beta), which is correlated with different FSH beta levels in quail and chicken. We re-sequenced 31 quails (10 wild, 11 egg-type, and 10 meat-type) and identified 18 and 26 candidate selective sweep regions in the egg-type and meat-type lines, respectively. That only one of them is shared between egg-type and meat-type lines suggests that they were subject to an independent selection. We also detected a haplotype on chromosome Z, which was closely linked with maroon/yellow plumage in quail using population resequencing and a genome-wide association study. This haplotype block will be useful for quail breeding programs. Conclusions: This study provided a high-quality quail reference genome, identified quail-specific genes, and resolved quail phylogeny. We have identified genes related to quail early maturation and a marker for plumage color, which is significant for quail breeding. These results will facilitate biological discovery in quails and help us elucidate the evolutionary processes within the Phasianidae family.";"Japanese quail; genome assembly; early maturation; phylogeny; resequencing; plumage color; quail breeding";2018;"GIGASCIENCE";"Biology; Multidisciplinary Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

It is well-known that the hatching time of duck embryos is approximately one week longer than that of chicken embryos. However, the key features associated with the slower embryonic development in ducks have not been adequately described. This study aimed to characterize the pattern and the speed of early embryogenesis in Brown Tsaiya Ducks (BTD) compared with those in Taiwan Country Chicken (TCC) by using growth parameters including embryonic crown-tail length (ECTL), primitive streak formation, somitogenesis, and other development-related parameters, during the first 72 h of incubation. Three hundred and sixty eggs from BTD and TCC, respectively, were incubated at 37.2 degrees C, and were then dissected hourly to evaluate their developmental stages. We found that morphological changes of TCC embryos shared a major similarity with that of the Hamburger and Hamilton staging system during early chick embryogenesis. The initial primitive streak in TCC emerged between 6 and 7 h post-incubation, but its emergence was delayed until 10 to 13 h post-incubation in BTD. Similarly, the limb primordia (wing and limb buds) were observed at 51 h post-incubation in TCC embryos compared to 64 h post-incubation in BTD embryos. The allantois first appeared around 65 to 68 h in TCC embryos, but it was not observed in BTD embryos. At the 72 h post-incubation, 40 somites were clearly formed in TCC embryos while only 32 somites in BTD embryos. Overall, the BTD embryos developed approximately 16 h slower than the chicken embryo during the first 72 h of development. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to describe two distinct developmental time courses between TCC and BTD, which would facilitate future embryogenesis-related studies of the two important avian species in Taiwan.";NA;2018;"PLOS ONE";"Multidisciplinary Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Here, we present a mathematical model applicable to ectothermic and endothermic vertebrates. It is designed to test whether differences in the timing of sexual maturation within an animal's life (age at which sexual maturity is reached vs. longevity) together with its ontogenetic gain in body mass (growth curve) can predict the energy intake throughout the animal's life (food intake curve) and can explain differences in energy partitioning (between growth, reproduction, heat production and maintenance, with the latter subsuming any other additional task requiring energy) between ectothermic and endothermic vertebrates. With our model we calculated from the growth curves and ages at which species reached sexual maturity energy intake functions and energy partitioning for five ectothermic and seven endothermic vertebrate species. We show that our model produces energy intake patterns and distributions as observed in ectothermic and endothermic species. Our results comply consistently with some empirical studies that in endothermic species, like birds and mammals, energy is used for heat production instead of growth, and with a hypothesis on the evolution of endothermy in amniotes published by us before. Our model offers an explanation on known differences in absolute energy intake between ectothermic fish and reptiles and endothermic birds and mammals. From a mathematical perspective, the model comes in two equivalent formulations, a differential and an integral one. It is derived from a discrete level approach, and it is shown to be well-posed and to attain a unique solution for (almost) every parameter set. Numerically, the integral formulation of the model is considered as an inverse problem with unknown parameters that are estimated using a series of empirical data. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we examine how food availability and key nutrients have been reported to shape innate and adaptive immunity in wildlife by drawing from field-based studies, as well as captive and food restriction studies with wildlife species. Examples of food provisioning and key nutrients enhancing immune function were seen across the three study type distinctions, as were cases of trace metals and pharmaceuticals impairing the immunity of wildlife species. More generally, food provisioning in field studies tended to increase innate and adaptive responses to certain immune challenges, whereas patterns were less clear in captive studies. Mild food restriction often enhanced, whereas severe food restriction frequently impaired immunity. However, to enable stronger conclusions we stress a need for further research, especially field studies, and highlight the importance of integrating nutritional manipulation, immune challenge, and functional outcomes. Despite current gaps in research on this topic, modern high throughput molecular approaches are increasingly feasible for wildlife studies and offer great opportunities to better understand human influences on wildlife health.

Roth groups offish were subjected to experimental confinement (collective and individual) for three days. Additionally, 11 fish were tagged with radio transmitters for telemetry monitoring. Mortality rate was estimated as the percentage of dead individuals for each type of bait and confinement. For peacock bass caught with jig baits, mortality was zero.

The biocomplexity approach refers to a fully integrated social-ecological systems (SES) simulation that represents bidirectional feedbacks between social and ecological components. This method is essential to accurately assess impacts of economy and policy on SES such as agroecosystems, where feedbacks between the drivers and impacts of cropping changes need to be simulated. Here we exemplify the biocomplexity approach using energy maize, which is becoming an important source of bioenergy in Europe, and thus, might cause a significant change in land use with knock on-effects for wildlife. 2. The integrated simulation tool consisted of a farmer decision-making agent-based model fully coupled to the Animal Landscape and Man Simulatin System (ALMaSS), an agent-based simulation system for predicting impacts of land use on a range of Danish wildlife species: the brown hare (Lepus europaeus), the grey partridge (Perdix perdix), the skylark (Alauda arvensis), a carabid beetle (Bembidion lampros), a linyphiid spider (Erigone atra) and the field vole (Microtus agrestis). This was used to assess the impacts of increasing demand on energy maize on the six animal species. Two types of experimental scenarios were evaluated, with and without feedback between the social and ecological system. The assessment of species responses was based on changes in population size, abundance and occupancy. 3. The response to the cultivation of energy maize was negative for three vertebrate species (skylark, hare and field vole) and positive for partridge and the two invertebrate species. The feedback scenarios showed that the incorporation of information from ecological system to the farmer decision-making affected both a trend in area cultivated with energy maize as well as the animal responses. 4. Synthesis and applications. Fully coupling agent-based decision-making and environmental simulation allows a detailed representation and integration of both social and ecological components of agricultural systems at proper spatial and temporal scales as well as of dynamic feedbacks between the two systems. By employing easy to interpret measures of changes in abundance and spatial occupancy of animal species, the simulation results could inform and simplify decision-making on expected impacts of economy and policy regulations on wildlife.";"agent-based model; agricultural systems; agroecology; ALMaSS; biocomplexity; energy crop; hare; impact assessment; skylark; social-ecological systems";2018;"JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY";"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Understanding the effects of long-term grazing on sagebrush and bunchgrass str ucture is important because sagebrush is a keystone species and bunchgrasses are tire dominant herbaceous functional group in these communities. To investigate the effects of long-term grazing on sagebrush and bunchgrass structure, we compared nine grazing exclosures with nine adjacent rangelands that were grazed by cattle in southeast Oregon. Grazing was moderate utilization (30 - 45%) with altering season of use and infrequent rest. Long-term grazing by cattle altered some structural aspects of bunchgrasses and sagebrush. Ungrazed bunchgrasses had larger dead centers in their crowns, as well as greater dead fuel depths below and above the crown level compared with grazed bunchgrasses. This accumulation of dry fuel near the mcristcmatic tissue may increase the probability of fire-induced mortality during a wildfire. Bunchgrasses in the ungrazed treatment had more reproductive stems than those in the long-term grazed treatment. This suggests that seed production of bunchgrasses may be greater in ungrazed areas. Sagebrush height and longest canopy diameter were 15% and 20% greater in the un grazed compared with the grazed treatment, respectively. However, the bottom of the sagebmsh canopy was closer to the ground in the grazed compared with the ungrazed treatment, which may provide better hiding cover for ground-nesting avian species. Sagebrush basal stem diameter, number of stems, amount of dead material in the canopy, canopy gap size, and number of canopy gaps did not differ between un grazed and grazed treatments. Moderate grazing does not appear to alter the competitive relationship between a generally unpalatable shrub and palatable bunchgrasses. Long-term, moderate grazing appears to have minimal effects to the structure of bunchgrasses and sagebrush, other than reducing the risk of bunchgrass mortality during a fire event.

Big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata spp.) communities, iconic to western North America, have been treated to restore herbaceous understories through chemical, mechanical, and prescribed burning practices thought to improve habitat conditions for greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and other species. Although the response of structural attributes of sagebrush communities to treatments is well understood, there is a need to identify how treatments influence wildlife population dynamics. We investigated the influence of vegetation treatments occurring in Wyoming, United States, from 1994 to 2012 on annual sage-grouse population change using yearly male sage-grouse lek counts. We investigated this response across 1, 3, 5, and 10-year post-treatment lags to evaluate how the amount of treated sagebrush communities and time since treatment influenced population change, while accounting for climate, wildfire, and anthropogenic factors. With the exception of chemical treatments exhibiting a positive association with sage-grouse population change 11years after implementation, population response to treatments was either neutral or negative for at least 11years following treatments. Our work supports a growing body of research advocating against treating big sagebrush habitats for sage-grouse, particularly in Wyoming big sagebrush (A. t. wyomingensis). Loss and fragmentation of sagebrush habitats has been identified as a significant threat for remaining sage-grouse populations. Because sagebrush may take decades to recover following treatments, we recommend practitioners use caution when designing projects to alter remaining habitats, especially when focused on habitat requirements for one life stage and a single species.";"Centrocercus urophasianus; herbicide application; mechanical treatment; population change; prescribed burning; wildfire";2018;"RESTORATION ECOLOGY";"Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Birds are ecologically diverse and span a large range of body size and limb proportions, yet all use their hindlimbs for bipedal terrestrial locomotion, for at least some part of their life history. Here, we review the scaling of avian striding bipedal gaits to explore how body mass and leg morphology influence walking and running. We collate literature data from 21 species, spanning a 2500x range in body mass from painted quail to ostriches. Using dynamic similarity theory to interpret scaling trends, we find evidence for independent effects of body mass, leg length and leg posture on gait. We find no evidence for scaling of duty factor with body size, suggesting that vertical forces scale with dynamic similarity. However, at dynamically similar speeds, large birds use relatively shorter stride lengths and higher stride frequencies compared with small birds. We also find that birds with long legs for their mass, such as the white stork and red-legged seriema, use longer strides and lower swing frequencies, consistent with the influence of high limb inertia on gait. We discuss the observed scaling of avian bipedal gait in relation to mechanical demands for force, work and power relative to muscle actuator capacity, muscle activation costs related to leg cycling frequency, and considerations of stability and agility. Many opportunities remain for future work to investigate how morphology influences gait dynamics among birds specialized for different habitats and locomotor behaviors.";"Bird; Walking; Running; Dynamic similarity; Biomechanics; Energetics; Leg morphology; Stability; Systematic review; Meta-analysis";2018;"JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY";"Biology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

To expand our understanding of how species respond to environmental factors, we investigated the reproductive ecology of two ground-nesting species (northern bobwhite [Colinas virginianus] and scaled quail [Callipepla squamata]) in a region (i.e., the Southern Great Plains) prone to thermal variability (i.e., extreme hot and cold temperatures). Specifically, our objective was to examine how temperature and precipitation directly influenced behavioral adjustments (i.e., off-bout duration, frequency, and nest attentiveness) and parental decisions (i.e., nest site selection), and indirectly influenced nest fate. Overall, we found that parents chose to nest in sites that were significantly cooler in temperature than randomly selected sites, and parents further altered the thermal environment experienced by embryos through incubation behavior. Daily precipitation and average ambient temperature and/or their interaction best predicted incubation behaviors, yet each species differed in the timing (i.e., morning vs. evening), frequency, and duration of off-bouts. Furthermore, successful nests were associated with cooler nest site temperatures for bobwhite and warmer nest site temperatures for scaled quail. Our finding of relatively stable (35.5 degrees C) incubation temperature for developing embryos of both species suggests that ground-nesting birds are able to regulate microclimate through behavioral adjustments and parental decisions even under extreme temperature fluctuations. Nevertheless, the ability for a ground-nesting species to effectively modify behavioral adjustments and decisions may be altered during long periods of enhanced physiological and environmental stress.";"Behavioral adjustments; Colinus virginianus; Callipepla squamata; Incubation behavior; Precipitation; Thermal variability";2018;"JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY";"Biology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Likewise, recovery rates (%) of aforementioned parameters after cryopreservation and absolute livability index were observed highest (P<0.05) with 20% glycerol. By comparing values of R-2 after multivariate regression analysis, least negative effects of hours of incubation were observed on semen quality in extenders with 20% glycerol followed by 15% and 11% glycerol. The fertility outcomes (number of fertile eggs, fertility [%], number of hatched chicks, percent hatch and hatchability of fertilised eggs) were recorded higher (P<0.05) with 20% glycerol followed by 15% and 11% glycerol. It is concluded that the concentration of 20% glycerol gives the best cryoprotection for quality and fertility of Indian Red Jungle Fowl semen.";"glycerol; sperm viability; fertility; Indian Red Jungle Fowl";2018;"AVIAN BIOLOGY RESEARCH";"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Ornithology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Correlations between the left and right testicular gross anatomical and histological biometric traits were strong and positive. Left biased asymmetry was recorded in the Guinea Fowl. Absolute testicular asymmetry increased with age, but tended to stabilise from 20 weeks of age, while relative testicular asymmetry remained stable throughout.

Environmental drivers such as climatic variability, operating on large spatial scales, have been proposed to be a driver of the spatial synchrony of avian and mammalian populations (i.e., the Moran effect). On the other hand, demographic responses to heterogeneous, local environments may result in substantial local population variability (i.e., variance across multiple populations). This study used the Bayesian hierarchical spatiotemporal dynamic model to determine the spatiotemporal dynamic patterns of 27 eastern wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) populations scattered across Mississippi, USA, from 1994 to 2005. The regional effects of seasonal climate and relative amount of forest in habitats were also evaluated to test the Moran effect. Twenty seven wild turkey populations had a spatial synchrony with the strength and spatial scale similar to those of other avian populations in North America. Warming spring or spring-autumn climate appeared to reduce wild turkey relative abundance; however, winter climate did not influence the dynamics of wild turkey populations in Mississippi. Average proportion of forest affected the average relative abundance of wild turkeys in a nonlinear manner, with its positive effects switching to a lessened constant effect beyond the threshold of 60% forest cover. However, regional climatic variability was unlikely to synchronize wild turkey populations in Mississippi. This study proposed a hypothesis concerning regional habitat quality degradation, which may cause regional population declines and synchronize the dynamics of animal populations.";"Bayesian hierarchical model; Habitat degradation hypothesis; Meleagris gallopavo silvestris; Moran effect; Spatial synchrony; Threshold response";2018;"ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS";"Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Broad-scale habitat protections on behalf of an umbrella species are assumed to benefit co-occurring taxa, but targeted management actions to improve local habitat suitability for the umbrella species may produce unintended effects on other species. Our objective was to quantify the effects of a common habitat treatment (mowing of big sagebrush [Artemisia tridentata]) intended to benefit a high-profile umbrella species (Greater Sage-Grouse [Centrocercus urophasianus]) on 3 sympatric songbird species of concern. We used a before-after control-impact experimental design spanning 3 yr in Wyoming, USA, to quantify the effect of mowing on the abundance, nest-site selection, nestling condition, and nest survival of 2 sagebrush-obligate songbirds (Brewer's Sparrow [Spizella breweri] and Sage Thrasher [Oreoscoptes montanus]) and one open-habitat generalist songbird (Vesper Sparrow [Pooecetes gramineus]). Mowing was associated with lower abundance of Brewer's Sparrows and Sage Thrashers but higher abundance of Vesper Sparrows. We found no Brewer's Sparrows or Sage Thrashers nesting in the mowed footprint posttreatment, which suggests complete loss of nesting habitat for these species. Mowing was associated with higher nestling condition and nest survival for Vesper Sparrows but not for the sagebrush-obligate species. Management prescriptions that remove woody biomass within a mosaic of intact habitat may be tolerated by sagebrush-obligate songbirds but are likely more beneficial for open-habitat generalist species. By definition, umbrella species conservation entails habitat protections at broad spatial scales. We caution that habitat manipulations to benefit Greater Sage-Grouse could negatively affect nontarget species of conservation concern if implemented across large spatial extents.";"Greater Sage-Grouse; habitat management; mowing; nontarget effects; sagebrush songbirds; surrogate species; umbrella species";2018;"CONDOR";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

In comparison, little attention has been paid to species' mechanistic responses to fine-grained, climate-induced modifications of habitat suitability. However, such studies would be pivotal to the understanding of species' ecological requirements (and hence their adaptive potential to environmental change) and the design of management strategies. We investigated foraging microhabitat selection in a potentially climate-change sensitive species, the white-winged snowfinch Monafringilla nivalis, during the breeding season in the Alps. Our microhabitat selection model considered topography, ground-cover variables and sward height within a 5-m radius at foraging and control locations. Habitat selection was positively affected by grassland cover, negatively by sward height and quadratically by snow cover (optimum around 40%); birds avoided anthropized (urban areas, roads) sites. We estimated past (1976) and future (2066) climate-driven changes in foraging microhabitat suitability, assuming a progressively earlier date of snowmelt due to increasing temperatures over this entire time span. We then modelled the potential impact of snowmelt (and related sward height) on habitat suitability under two scenarios: maintaining the current situation (i.e. irregular seasonal grazing) and implementing targeted management in an attempt to mitigate impacts of earlier snowmelt. Predicted foraging habitat suitability (estimated as the fraction of suitable plots) significantly declined over time (-23% between 1976 and 2016, further 32% loss by 2066). However, model outputs demonstrated that maintaining sward height below 6 cm on breeding grounds (e.g. by regular grazing) would significantly decrease the predicted loss of suitable foraging habitat. Detailed information about patterns of resource exploitation allows the identification of mechanistic, functional responses of species to environmental change, and enables an evaluation of habitat management options that can buffer against the detrimental effects of global warming.";"Alps; Habitat selection; Microhabitat; Mitigation; Montifringilla nivalis; Snow cover; Snowmelt";2018;"BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION";"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We documented Wild Turkey nests (n = 107) and hen mortalities (n = 28), which were used to model the effect of bobcat, coyote, and Wild Turkey habitat use on turkey nest success and mortality. Increased coyote use was associated with higher nest success and increased turkey use was associated with higher probability of mortality.

In primates and other mammals, descriptions of this ability typically emphasize the neural processing that takes place in the cerebral neocortex. However, non-mammals such as birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish, which completely lack a neocortex, also have the ability to selectively attend. In this article, we survey the behavioral evidence for selective attention in non-mammals, and review the midbrain and forebrain structures that are responsible. The ancestral forms of selective attention are presumably selective orienting behaviors, such as prey-catching and predator avoidance. These behaviors depend critically on a set of subcortical structures, including the optic tectum (OT), thalamus and striatum, that are highly conserved across vertebrate evolution. In contrast, the contributions of different pallial regions in the forebrain to selective attention have been subject to more substantial changes and reorganization. This evolutionary perspective makes plain that selective attention is not a function achieved de novo with the emergence of the neocortex, but instead is implemented by circuits accrued and modified over hundreds of millions of years, beginning well before the forebrain contained a neocortex. Determining how older subcortical circuits interact with the more recently evolved components in the neocortex will likely be crucial for understanding the complex properties of selective attention in primates and other mammals, and for identifying the etiology of attention disorders.

Even though juvenile and adult birds are endothermic and maintain a constant, high body temperature by means of internal heat production, they begin life expressing an ectothermic phenotype. Depending on where a species falls along a continuum of maturity at hatching, from precocial to altricial, they begin to express endothermic traits either close to the time of hatching or as nestlings over a period of 1-3 weeks. Developing endothermy requires attaining a high basal metabolic rate and associated aerobic scope to produce sufficient internal heat, insulation to retain the internally produced heat, and a thermostat that ""turns on"" heat production in response to cooling ambient temperatures. To support the high metabolic costs of endothermy, the animal must have the capacity to deliver sufficient oxygen and nutrients to the heat-generating tissues. In this review, we examine the development of physiological and morphological traits that are required for endothermy and discuss their potential to limit the development of endothermy. These include ventilatory and cardiovascular function, contribution of visceral organ masses, membrane lipid composition, substrate supply pathways, and skeletal muscle physiology.

First, accuracy and precision of blood Hg concentrations for entire DBS and DBS punches were determined for white leghorn chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) dosed with methylmercury (MeHg) via egg injection. Next, we investigated Hg stability in chicken DBS subjected to time, temperature, and humidity treatments. Lastly, we applied the method to DBS created using standard field methods from zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttatato) in the laboratory and American golden-plover (Pluvalis dominica) sampled in the field. All samples were analyzed for total Hg (THg) using direct Hg analysis. Accuracy was determined by comparing DBS concentrations with those of corresponding whole blood and reported as percent recovery. Accuracy for entire chicken DBS was 101.8 +/- 5.4%, while DBS punches revealed lower recovery (87.7 +/- 4.0 to 92.4 +/- 4.1%). There was little effect of time, temperature, and humidity storage treatments on Hg concentrations of DBS, with mean DBS THg concentrations within +/- 8% of whole blood (n = 10 treatments). For zebra finch, DBS punches were more accurate (93.7 +/- 9.7%) compared to entire DBS (126.8 +/- 19.4%).

We summarize the recent findings, identify knowledge gaps, and provide future research directions investigating the role of TH-mediated maternal effects in ecological context across taxa. Surprisingly, data on the sources of naturally occurring variation in maternal THs and their fitness effects are lacking in most vertebrate taxa. There is considerable variation in maternal TH levels in eggs across taxa. Avian egg THs show heritable variation, and data from fish and amphibians suggest female consistency in egg TH levels. In birds, variation in maternal THs was associated with important ecological factors, such as food availability and temperature. THs also showed intraindividual variation varying systematically within clutches. Importantly, exposure to maternal THs within naturally occurring range affected offspring fitness-related traits (growth and survival) in birds and fish.

In this study, the growing follicles from domestic hens (Gallus domesticus) were isolated using enzymatic and mechanical methods and then investigated for the optimized conditions for culture. Assessments of viability and hormonal responsiveness were also considered. A larger percentage of healthy follicles was achieved by mechanical separation than enzymatic dissociation (83% vs. 55% by collagenase I or 63% by trypsin), despite a lower recovery yield for the former (126 vs. 275 by collagenase I or 261 by trypsin) from each ovary. All of the mechanically isolated follicles (800 gm) survived when cultured in the 3-dimensional (3D) system for 7 days whereas only 93% of the follicles survived in the 2-dimensional (2D) group. Follicles cultured in the 3D system also had a higher cell proliferation rates but lower apoptotic rates as assessed by BrdU incorporation and TUNEL assays. Ultrastructural examination showed that the granulosa cells in the 3D group were organized tightly with adjacent layers in contrast to the loose attachment in the 2D system group. After treatment with follicle-stimulating hormone in the 3D culture for 3 days, the mechanically isolated follicles (800 pm) displayed elevated mRNA expression of steroidogenic enzymes, cytokines and cell cycle-regulating proteins.

Mosquito control is an important means of controlling the spread of WNv, as the virus is primarily spread between avian and mosquito vectors. This is of particular concern for avian host species such as the Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), in which WNv negatively impacts fitness parameters. Most mosquito control methods focus on the larval stages. In North America, control efforts are largely limited to larvicides, which require repeated application and have potentially negative ecological impacts. There are multiple potential advantages to using indigenous fish species as an alternative for larval control including lowered environmental impact, decreased costs in terms of time and financial inputs, and the potential for the establishment of self-sustaining fish populations.

We introduced minnows into 10 treatment reservoirs and monitored an additional 6 non treated reservoirs as controls over 3 years. Adult mosquitoes of species known to transmit WNv (e.g., Culex tarsalis) were captured at each site and mosquito larvae were also present at all sites. Stable isotope analysis confirmed that introduced fathead minnows were feeding at the mosquito larvae trophic level in all but one treatment pond. Treatment ponds demonstrated suppressed levels of mosquito larva over each season compared to controls with a model-predicted 114% decrease in larva density within treatment ponds. Minnows established self-sustaining populations throughout the study in all reservoirs that maintained sufficient water levels. Minnow survival was not influenced by water quality. Though minnows did not completely eradicate mosquito larvae, minnows are a promising alternative to controlling mosquito larvae density within reservoirs. We caution that careful site selection is critical to avoid potential negative impacts, but suggest the introduction of fathead minnows in reservoirs can dramatically reduce mosquito larva abundance and potentially help mitigate vector-borne disease transmission.";NA;2018;"PLOS ONE";"Multidisciplinary Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Here, we investigated the hypothesis that personality variation in aggression is sexually selected in the monogamous, bi-parental cichlid Pelvicachromis pulcher. In this species, breeding pairs form territories and they aggressively defend their territory and offspring against con- and heterospecific intruders. In our mate choice study, we followed up two alternative hypotheses. We either expected females to show a directional preference for a high level and high consistency of aggression (potentially indicating mate choice for male parental quality). Alternatively, we expected females to choose males for (dis-)similarity in the level/consistency of aggression (potentially indicating mate choice for compatibility). Individual level and consistency of aggression were assessed for males and females using mirror tests. After eavesdropping on aggressive behaviour of two males (differing in level and consistency of aggression) females were then allowed to choose between the two males. Males, but not females, showed personality variation in aggression. Further, females generally preferred consistent over inconsistent males independent of their level of aggression. We did not detect a general preference for the level of male aggression. However, we found an above average preference for consistent high-aggression males; whereas female preference for inconsistent high-aggression did not deviate from random choice. Our results suggest behavioural consistency of aggression in male rainbow kribs is selected for via female mate choice.

Alphaviruses are arthropod-borne, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses (""arboviruses"") responsible for millions of cases of human illnesses each year. Buggy Creek virus (BCRV) is a unique alphavirus that is transmitted by a cimicid insect, the swallow bug, and is amplified in two avian species: the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) and the cliff swallow (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota). BCRV, like many alphaviruses, exhibits age-dependent susceptibility where the young are most susceptible to developing disease and exhibit a high mortality rate. However, alpha virus disease etiology in nestling birds is unknown. In this study, we infected nestling house sparrows with Buggy Creek virus and measured virological, pathological, growth, and digestive parameters following infection. Buggy Creek virus caused severe encephalitis in all infected nestlings, and the peak viral concentration in brain tissue was over 34 times greater than any other tissue. Growth, tissue development, and digestive function were all significantly impaired during BCRV infection. However, based on histopathological analysis performed, this impairment does not appear to be the result of direct tissue damage by the virus, but likely caused by encephalitis and neuronal invasion and impairment of the central nervous system. This is the first study to examine the course of alphavirus diseases in nestling birds and these results will improve our understanding of age-dependent infections of alphaviruses in vertebrate hosts.";NA;2018;"PLOS ONE";"Multidisciplinary Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Empirically driven models for population dynamics and demographic processes across multiple spatial scales can be powerful tools to help guide conservation actions. Integrated population models (IPMs) provide a framework for better parameter estimation by unifying multiple sources of data (e.g., count and demographic data). Hierarchical structure within such models that include random effects allow for varying degrees of data sharing across different spatiotemporal scales. We developed an IPM to investigate Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) on the border of California and Nevada, known as the Bi-State Distinct Population Segment. Our analysis integrated 13 years of lek count data (n > 2,000) and intensive telemetry (VHF and GPS; n > 350 individuals) data across 6 subpopulations. Specifically, we identified the most parsimonious models among varying random effects and density-dependent terms for each population vital rate (e.g., nest survival). Using a joint likelihood process, we integrated the lek count data with the demographic models to estimate apparent abundance and refine vital rate parameter estimates. To investigate effects of climatic conditions, we extended the model to fit a precipitation covariate for instantaneous rate of change (r). At a metapopulation extent (i.e. Bi-State), annual population rate of change lambda (e(r)) did not favor an overall increasing or decreasing trend through the time series. However, annual changes in lambda were driven by changes in precipitation (one-year lag effect). At subpopulation extents, we identified substantial variation in lambda and demographic rates. One subpopulation clearly decoupled from the trend at the metapopulation extent and exhibited relatively high risk of extinction as a result of low egg fertility. These findings can inform localized, targeted management actions for specific areas, and status of the species for the larger Bi-State.";"Bayesian analysis; Bi-State Distinct Population Segment; Centrocercus urophasianus; climate; demographic; density dependence; ecological scale; environmental stochasticity; precipitation; random effect";2018;"AUK";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Over the past century, sagebrush-reduction treatments have been applied widely throughout western North America to increase herbaceous vegetation for livestock and wildlife. We used indices from satellite imagery to 1) quantify effects of prescribed-fire, herbicide, and mechanical treatments on vegetative cover, productivity, and phenology, and 2) describe how vegetation changed over time following these treatments. We hypothesized that treatments would increase herbaceous cover and accordingly shift phenologies towards those typical of grass-dominated systems. We expected prescribed burns would lead to the greatest and most-prolonged effects on vegetative cover and phenology, followed by herbicide and mechanical treatments. Treatments appeared to increase herbaceous cover and productivity, which coincided with signs of earlier senescence signals expected of grass-dominated systems, relative to sagebrush-dominated systems. Spatial heterogeneity for most phenometrics was lower in treated areas relative to controls, which suggested treatment-induced homogenization of vegetative communities. Phenometrics that explain spring migrations of ungulates mostly were unaffected by sagebrush treatments. Fire had the strongest effect on vegetative cover, and yielded the least evidence for sagebrush recovery. Overall, treatment effects were small relative to those reported from field-based studies for reasons most likely related to sagebrush recovery, treatment specification, and untreated patches within mosaicked treatment applications. Treatment effects were also small relative to inter-annual variation in phenology and productivity that was explained by temperature, snowpack, and growing-season precipitation. Our results indicated that cumulative NDVI, late-season phenometrics, and spatial heterogeneity of several phenometrics may serve as useful indicators of vegetative change in sagebrush ecosystems.";"Artemisia spp; MODIS; NDVI; Phenology; Prescribed fire; Sagebrush";2018;"ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS";"Biodiversity Conservation; Environmental Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

However, previous studies report conflicting results in the relationship between variation in the proportion of first-year birds and variation in climatic conditions. We used wing data of hunter-shot Eurasian wigeon from Finland to study whether the proportion of first-year birds shows a similar long-term decline and whether between-year variation in the proportion of young is associated with variation in climatic conditions. We found a long-term decline in the proportion of first-year birds. The proportion of young also varied considerably between years, but this variation was not associated with weather or the climatic variables considered for the breeding and wintering periods.

Therefore, captive breeding of this species is common for its conservation. The present study was designed to elucidate various parameters of sexual behavior of this bird, such as breeding season, clutch size, hatching time, age at maturity of both male and female and breeding interval under captive conditions in Punjab, Pakistan. It was observed that the mean clutch size of P. cristatus at one captive site, government zoological gardens, was 8.6 +/- 0.55eggs and at the other captive site (private sectors) were 7.24 +/- 0.6 eggs. Female birds spent more time in feeding and less time in standing compared to their respective males. Similarly, females spent significantly more time in walking and running but less time in sitting, preening and calling compared to their respective males. Indian peafowls breed from May to August at the two field captive sites. Time for hatching of eggs of P. cristatus was observed to be 27.92 +/- 0.17days and 27.96 +/- 0.12days at the government and private sites, respectively. At these sites, the bird breeds only once in a year. Age at reproductive maturity of female Indian peafowl was 2.41 +/- 0.13 years and 2.26 +/- 0.12 years and of male was 2.65 +/- 0.65 and 2.71 +/- 0.63 years, respectively at both government and private captivity sectors. The results of the present study should be helpful especially to farmers for information concerning the breeding season and behavioral activities of the bird under captivity.

Yet little is known about its short-term regeneration dynamics and the implications of those dynamics for changes in stand structure. We examined changes among sagebrush size classes across 3 years, as well as emergence of sagebrush from seed bank and seed rain samples at 2 sagebrush shrubland sites in northern Utah: a lower-density site (1.4 plants/m(2), SE 0.11) with no recent history of manipulation and a higher-density site (1.9 plants/m(2), SE 0.21) that had recently been treated with herbicide to reduce sagebrush cover. On both sites, numbers of sagebrush plants in the largest size class decreased over the 3-year time period, while dead and medium-sized sagebrush plants increased. At the higher-density herbicide-treated site, this size class shift appeared to be driven by growth of small plants into the medium size class, likely associated with reductions in numbers of (and competition from) large plants. At the lower-density site, it appears that densities of large plants declined because the plants shrank in size, possibly due to herbivory. Sagebrush seed rain did not differ between fall and spring assessments. Forbs had the greatest representation in the seed bank, followed by grasses and then sagebrush, though the number of sagebrush seeds may be sufficient for seedling recruitment. These results illustrate that shifts among sagebrush size classes, especially transitions of small shrubs into the medium size class, may be a primary and immediate pathway of stand recovery, in addition to recruitment from seed.

However, hampered by data limitations, including incomplete and spatially biased data, relatively few studies have used multidecadal datasets or have examined changes in biogeography from a historical perspective. The black-billed capercaillie (Tetrao urogalloides) is a large capercaillie (classified as Least Concern [LC] on the IUCN red list) that has undergone a dramatic decline in population during the late 20th century and is considered endangered. Its conservation status is pessimistic, and the species requires immediate protection. Therefore, we supplemented a historical dataset to identify changes in this bird's range and population in northeast China over the long term. The study area spanned Heilongjiang Province, Jilin Province, and the northeast corner of Inner Mongolia in northeast China. We integrated an ecological niche model (BIOMOD2) with long-term ecological data on this species to estimate the magnitude of change in distribution over time. Our results revealed a 35.25% reduction in the current distribution of this species compared to their potential distribution in the 1970s. This decline is expected to continue under climate change. For example, the future range loss was estimated to be 38.79 +/- 0.22% (8.64-90.19%), and the actual state could be worse, because the baseline range of the model was greater than the real range in the 2000s, showing a 12.39% overestimation. To overcome this poor outlook, a conservation strategy should be established in sensitive areas, including the southwestern Greater Khingan Mountains and northern Lesser Khingan Mountains.

Furthermore, artefactual signals as well as contamination are more likely to occur when DNA is limited. To increase the reliability of DNA typing from noninvasive samples, optimized DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction protocols were developed, taking advantage of developments in the forensic field aiming at successful molecular genetic analysis of DNA templates being low in quality and quantity. In the framework of an extensive monitoring project on population dynamics of capercaillie and black grouse in the Tyrolean Alps, feces samples and molted feathers from both species were collected. On a subset comprising about 200 specimens of either species, eight polymorphic short tandem repeat (STR) markers were analyzed to test these improved protocols. Besides optimizing DNA yields, both lowered sample consumption and reduced hands-on time were achieved, and the rates of informative profiles amounted to 90.7% for capercaillie and 92.4% for black grouse. Similarly, high success rates had not been achieved in earlier studies and demonstrate the benefit of the improved methodology, which should be easily adaptable for use on animal species other than those studied here. The STR genotypes were not only powerful enough to discriminate among unrelated birds but also appeared fit for telling apart closely related animals, as indicated by Pi and Pi(sib) values.

As such, it is assumed to have a pronounced, though still poorly explored, effect on hatchling phenotype. We tested the effect of experimentally increased egg white avidin concentration (AVIDIN+) on hatching success, chick morphology, post-hatching growth performance and innate immune function in a model bird, Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica). Probability of embryo survival in the late embryonic phase increased with increasing eggweight in control eggs, but not in AVIDIN+ eggs. Chicks hatching from lighter AVIDIN+ eggs had a shorter tarsus than chicks hatching fromheavier AVIDIN+ eggs. This suggests that an increase in egg white avidin favours embryo survival in lighter eggs during late embryogenesis, but at the expense of reduced structural body size. Plasma complement activity in 6-day-old AVIDIN+ chicks decreased with increasing body mass and tarsus length; the opposite was observed in control chicks, implying that the later post-hatching innate immune function of larger chicks was compromised by an increase in egg white avidin concentration.

In studies of birds during the autumn/winter at six pheasant shoots with high-density releases managed by full-time gamekeepers, predation of released pheasants by foxes before the shooting season began (July-September) averaged 19.2 +/- 4.0% per site, and during the shooting season (October 1st-February 1st), a further 15.9 +/- 1.9% were predated. The range in 3-year average predation rates between sites before shooting began was 8.6 to 42.4%. At seven different sites during the spring and summer, between 20 and 71% of released or wild hens that survived the shooting season were predated, mainly by foxes, between mid-March and mid-July. Predation was significantly higher at sites with low-level predator control (59 +/- 4.7%) compared to those with high-level control (30 +/- 5.3%). At three of the four sites with low predator control between 5 and 22% of nest failures were caused by incubating hens being predated by foxes. Our data quantify for the first time highly variable predation rates of released pheasants before and during the winter shooting season which we suggest was influenced by a range of site and management factors.

If fluctuations in abundance are related to changes in weather, proper management is especially important, because extreme weather events could disproportionately affect population abundance. Conservation assessments, especially for vulnerable populations, are aided by a knowledge of how extreme events influence population status and trends. Although important for conservation efforts, data may be limited for small or vulnerable populations. Integrated population models maximize information from various sources of data to yield population estimates that fully incorporate uncertainty from multiple data sources while allowing for the explicit incorporation of environmental covariates of interest. Our goal was to assess the relative influence of population drivers for the Lesser Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) in the core of its range, western and southern Kansas, USA. We used data from roadside lek count surveys, nest monitoring surveys, and survival data from telemetry monitoring combined with climate (Palmer drought severity index) data in an integrated population model. Our results indicate that variability in population growth rate was most influenced by variability in juvenile survival. The Palmer drought severity index had no measurable direct effects on adult survival or mean number of offspring per female; however, there were declines in population growth rate following severe drought. Because declines in population growth rate occurred at a broad spatial scale, declines in response to drought were likely due to decreases in chick and juvenile survival rather than emigration outside of the study area. Overall, our model highlights the importance of accounting for environmental and demographic sources of variability, and provides a thorough method for simultaneously evaluating population demography in response to long-term climate effects.";"climate change; drought; integrated population models; Lesser Prairie-Chicken; Tympanuchus pallidicinctus";2018;"AUK";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

To the contrary, Eurasian Wigeon (Mareca penelope) shows a strong negative trend in breeding numbers, which raises conservation concerns. Previous research suggests a causal link between recent population trajectories of the two species. Both preferentially breed on wetlands with abundant horsetail (Equisetum spp.), a plant providing food for Whooper Swan and crucial feeding microhabitat for Eurasian Wigeon broods. We here test predictions based on the hypothesis that grazing on Equisetum by Whooper Swan reduces breeding habitat or breeding habitat quality for Eurasian Wigeon. We use data from 60 lakes in which waterfowl were counted in 1990-1991 and 2016, and Equisetum was mapped in 1990-1991 and 2013-2014. Lakes colonized by Whooper Swan typically had more abundant Equisetum vegetation in the past than lakes not colonized. Lake-specific decrease of Equisetum was not associated with colonization by Whooper Swan. The number of lakes occupied by Eurasian Wigeon decreased, but the decrease was not stronger on lakes colonized by Whooper Swan than on those that were not. Contrary to our prediction, current Eurasian Wigeon abundance was positively associated with Whooper Swan abundance. Moreover, Eurasian Wigeon did not decrease more on lakes from which Equisetum disappeared than on lakes in which there was still Equisetum left.

The ephemeral nature of medullary bone hampers its observation in wild birds; thus, its phylogenetic distribution and ecophysiological correlates remain controversial. To address this, I candled a phylogenetically broad sample of bird skeletons spanning a large range of body sizes. I hypothesized that the presence of medullary bone would reduce or eliminate light penetrance through long bones. Candling suggested medullary bone was present in many adult female specimens, which was confirmed visually or with digital X-rays. This survey yielded the first unambiguous evidence of medullary bone in several taxa, including hummingbirds, tinamous, megapodes, and kiwi. The phylogenetic distribution of these new occurrences confirms that medullary bone is phylogenetically widespread among birds, including palaeognaths and passerines. The rapid assessment of complete skeletons supports a relationship between medullary bone and hematopoietic marrow, and establishes that the skeletal distribution of medullary bone varies taxonomically. Because the presence of medullary bone confirms sex, maturity, and reproductive status, its detection in specimens of known collection date can improve our understanding of life history and reproductive timing in wild birds, even decades later.";"Medullary bone; Reproduction; Museum collections; Life history; Candling";2018;"JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

According to the apparent competition hypothesis (ACH), less-abundant prey species (e.g. ptarmigan, waders and small passerines) will experience higher predation rates when breeding in association with the more common prey (geese), due to spill-over predation by the shared predator. As many of these less-abundant species are endemic and/or red-listed, increased predation can have negative repercussions on their populations. We used a one-year baited artificial nest study to assess relative nest predation risk on Svalbard Rock Ptarmigan Lagopus muta hyperborea, small waders (Purple Sandpiper Calidris maritima, Dunlin Calidris alpina, plovers Charadrius spp., and phalaropes Phalaropus spp.) and Snow bunting Plectrophenax nivalis in two study locations contrasted by nesting density of Arctic breeding geese (Pink-footed Goose Anser brachyrhynchus and Barnacle Goose Branta leucopsis).

Pinon-juniper woodlands have expanded beyond their historical geographic range in the western United States since European settlement. Many former stands of widely spaced old-growth juniper are now crowded with younger trees. Currently, federal and state land management agencies and private landowners are removing juniper trees to restore shrub-steppe for greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) across its geographic range, with little understanding of the treatment effects on roost site selection by bats. We used radio-telemetry to examine roost site selection of western long-eared myotis (Myotis evotis) at 3 spatial scales (roost, plot, and home range) during the breeding season. We attached radio-transmitters to 32 individuals and located 92 day roost sites for 25 different individuals. Lactating females selected rock crevices as roosts more frequently than tree cavities, whereas males used tree roosts and rock roosts more evenly. The majority of tree roosts were in pre-settlement trees that had at least 1 cavity. The odds that a tree was selected as a roost site increased with the number of available tree roosts within 17.8m of the roost site. Preference by lactating females for rock roost sites increased with the number of available rock roosts within 5m of the roost site and decreased with distance from water. Preference by males for rock roosts decreased if the roost was a single rock compared to an aggregate of rocks, increased with the number of available roosts within 5m of the roost site, decreased with distance from water, and increased with area of pre-settlement juniper woodland within 1km of the roost site. These results provide support for protecting pre-settlement juniper trees and rock formations near water sources in juniper woodlands to conserve existing populations of western long-eared myotis during the breeding season.

Besides impacts of habitat changes caused by current rates of land conversion, climatic influences or predators, a contribution of infectious pathogens needs also to be considered. Infectious and non-infectious diseases in free-living populations of ring-necked pheasants have been scarcely investigated so far. In the present study, carcasses of 258 deceased free-ranging pheasants of different age groups, predominantly adult pheasants, collected over a period of 4 years in the states of Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein, were examined pathomorphologically, parasitologically, virologically and bacteriologically, with a focus set on infectious pathogens. A periocular and perinasal dermatitis of unknown origin was present in 62.3% of the pheasants. Additional alterations included protozoal cysts in the skeletal musculature (19.0%), hepatitis (21.7%), enteritis (18.7%), gastritis (12.6%), and pneumonia (11.7%).

We studied 36 females, distributed into three stable groups (without group membership change) and three unstable groups (where the dominant member was rotated every week) over the course of 10 weeks. We evaluated the frequency of agonistic interactions, glucocorticoid metabolites (GCM) concentrations, and egg production. In both treatments, dominant hens produced more eggs compared to intermediate and subordinates, and intermediate hens had the highest GCM concentrations. Socially unstable groups had lower productivity and higher frequencies of agonistic interactions than stable groups. Social instability also affected GCM of the animals: in stable groups, subordinate hens had higher concentrations than dominants; in unstable groups, this pattern was reversed. Our results point to a social destabilisation in groups whose members were alternated, and suggest the welfare of individuals in unstable groups was compromised.

Treatment levels representing no rest; 1, 2, or 3 years of rest from grazing, and a burned-ungrazed control, all had similar effects on graminoid and forb basal cover and plant species density and frequency. However, grazing reduced litter cover and increased bare ground exposure relative to the control. A synthesis of this and other case studies of postfire grazing in sagebrush steppe indicates multiple years of rest from grazing are not strictly necessary for effective and timely recovery of vegetation but, on sloping terrain where potential runoff and erosion hazards exist, multiple years of rest may be needed to promote sufficient rates of litter recovery and reduction of bare ground exposure.

Additionally, we explore if brain monoamines can explain differences in judgement bias. Chicks exposed to cold stress did not differ in judgement bias compared to controls, but showed sensitivity to additional stressors by having higher motivation for social reinstatement. Environmental complexity reduced stress-induced negative judgement bias, by maintaining an optimistic bias in individuals housed in complex conditions even after stress exposure. Moreover, judgement bias was related to dopamine turnover rate in mesencephalon, with higher activity in individuals that had a more optimistic response.

This repeated use calls into question the influence of selection on specific warning colors adopted by aposematic prey-predator systems. To disentangle the influence of color characteristics on this process, we trained week-old chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) to learn to avoid distasteful food that was associated with one of three color signals (yellow, white, red) that varied in both hue and in brightness in order to assess which of these traits most influenced their ability to learn avoidance. Our results show that while chicks learned to avoid all three colors, avoidance was based on the hue, not brightness of the different signals. We found that yellow was the most effective for avoidance learning, followed by red, and finally white. Our results suggest that while these three colors are commonly used in aposematic signaling, predators' ability to learn avoidance differs among them. These results may explain why yellow is among the most common signals across aposematic taxa.";NA;2018;"PLOS ONE";"Multidisciplinary Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Recent comparative transcriptomic studies revealed that gene expression profiles of mid-embryonic period tend to be more evolutionarily conserved than those in earlier or later periods. While the hourglass-like divergence of developmental processes has been demonstrated in a variety of animal groups such as vertebrates, arthropods, and nematodes, the exact mechanism leading to this mid-embryonic conservation remains to be clarified. One possibility is that the mid-embryonic period (pharyngula period in vertebrates) is highly prone to embryonic lethality, and the resulting negative selections lead to evolutionary conservation of this phase. Here, we tested this ""mid-embryonic lethality hypothesis"" by measuring the rate of lethal phenotypes of three different species of vertebrate embryos subjected to two kinds of perturbations: transient perturbations and genetic mutations. Results: By subjecting zebrafish (Danio rerio), African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis), and chicken (Gallus gallus) embryos to transient perturbations, namely heat shock and inhibitor treatments during three developmental periods [early (represented by blastula and gastrula), pharyngula, and late], we found that the early stages showed the highest rate of lethal phenotypes in all three species. This result was corroborated by perturbation with genetic mutations. By tracking the survival rate of wild-type embryos and embryos with genetic mutations induced by UV irradiation in zebrafish and African clawed frogs, we found that the highest decrease in survival rate was at the early stages particularly around gastrulation in both these species. Conclusion: In opposition to the ""mid-embryonic lethality hypothesis,"" our results consistently showed that the stage with the highest lethality was not around the conserved pharyngula period, but rather around the early period in all the vertebrate species tested. These results suggest that negative selection by embryonic lethality could not explain hourglass-like conservation of animal embryos. This highlights the potential contribution of alternative mechanisms such as the diversifying effect of positive selections against earlier and later stages, and developmental constraints which lead to conservation of mid-embryonic stages.";"Developmental conservation; Hourglass model; Phylotypic period; Lethality; Pharyngula period";2018;"EVODEVO";"Evolutionary Biology; Developmental Biology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

In order to understand their nesting in diverse or extreme environments, the relationships between nests, nesting environments, and incubation methods in extant archosaurs were investigated. Statistical analyses reveal that species of extant covered nesters (i.e., crocodylians and megapodes) preferentially select specific sediments/substrates as a function of their nesting style and incubation heat sources. Relationships between dinosaur eggs and the sediments in which they occur reveal that hadrosaurs and some sauropods (i.e., megaloolithid eggs) built organic-rich mound nests that relied on microbial decay for incubation, whereas other sauropods (i.e., faveoloolithid eggs) built sandy in-filled hole nests that relied on solar or potentially geothermal heat for incubation. Paleogeographic distribution of mound nests and sandy in-filled hole nests in dinosaurs reveals these nest types produced sufficient incubation heat to be successful up to mid latitudes (<= 47 degrees), 10 degrees higher than covered nesters today. However, only mound nesting and likely brooding could have produced sufficient incubation heat for nesting above the polar circle (>66 degrees).

The proportion of overall metabolic rate accounted for by locomotor behaviour decreased over development, corresponding to declining activity levels, mean and peak walking speeds.

A scientific review of these potential effects was conducted with 106 published studies covering vascular and nonvascular plants, amphibians, birds, mammals, terrestrial invertebrates, and soil animals associated with fertilization in temperate and boreal forests, primarily in North America and Scandinavia. In terms of direct effects, amphibians and domestic mammals appear to be the most sensitive to urea used in fertilization programs. The avoidance behaviour and (or) mortality of amphibians in laboratory studies was species dependent. Ruminant animals, including wild ungulates, rapidly convert urea to ammonia and are susceptible to toxicity following ingestion of large amounts of urea. Feeding on urea pellets by small mammals or gallinaceous birds appears to be minimal as granules are unpalatable. In terms of indirect effects, the majority of responses of understory herbs to nitrogen fertilization showed an increase in abundance. Some shrubs in repeatedly fertilized stands eventually increased in abundance in long-term studies, whereas dwarf shrubs and abundance of bryophytes (mosses and terrestrial lichens) declined. In general, species richness and diversity of understory herbs and shrubs declined, or were unaffected, in fertilized stands. Response in abundance and species richness-diversity of vascular plants to a single application of nitrogen showed either an increase or no change. Repeated applications (2-5 and >5) usually resulted in declines in these responses. Relative abundance of mule deer (Odocoileus Rafinesque spp.), moose (Alces alces L.), and hares (Lepus L. spp.), and forage quantity and quality were usually increased by fertilization. Small mammal species generally showed increases or no change in abundance; decreases may be related to fertilizer-induced changes in food sources. Forest fertilization may provide winter feeding habitat for coniferous foliage-gleaning insectivorous birds in some cases. Six species of forest grouse showed no response to fertilizer treatments. Responses of soil animals to nitrogen fertilization appeared to be species-and dose-specific and are ameliorated by surrounding micro-and macro-habitat characteristics.";"abundance; biodiversity; forest fertilization; species richness and diversity; vascular plants; wildlife";2018;"ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS";"Environmental Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

It is not known whether CRH also controls TSH release in non-precocial avian species that have a different pattern of thyroidal activity during their life cycle. Therefore, we investigated the TSH-releasing capacity of CRH in an altricial species, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata). Cellular localisation of type 1 CRH receptor (CRHR1) and CRHR2 mRNA in the pituitary was determined by in situ hybridisation, combined with immunohistochemical staining of pituitary thyrotropes. In addition, isolated pituitary glands were stimulated with CRH to determine the effect on TSH release. Lastly, the mRNA levels of hormones and receptors involved in the control of thyroidal and adrenal function were measured by qPCR in zebra finch chicks between hatching and fledging, and in adults. Most of the hypophyseal CRHR2 mRNA co-localised with thyrotropes, whereas CRHR1 mRNA was found in between thyrotropes. Pituitary glands stimulated in vitro with CRH showed increased secretion of TSH-like activity. Pituitary CRHR2 mRNA expression decreased while pituitary TSHB mRNA and brain CRH mRNA levels increased towards fledging, similar as seen in chicken hatching. These results suggest that CRHR2 expressed on thyrotropes is likely mediating CRH-induced TSH release in altricial avian species like it does in precocial species, and that the increased thyroid hormone levels towards fledging in altricial birds are the result of increased hypothalamic stimulation, in which the thyrotropic activity of CRH may initially play a role.

Also humans are affected by the seasons with regard to immune responses and mental functions, the seasonal affective disorder being one of the most prominent examples. The hypophysial pars tuberalis (PT), an important interface between the hypophysial pars distalis and neuroendocrine centers in the brain, plays an essential role in the regulation of seasonal functions and may even be the seat of the circannual clock. Photoperiodic signals provide a major input to the PT. While the perception of these signals involves extraocular photoreceptors in non mammalian species (birds, fish), mammals perceive photoperiodic signals exclusively in the retina. A multisynaptic pathway connects the retina with the pineal organ where photoperiodic signals are translated into the neurohormone melatonin that is rhythmically produced night by night and encodes the length of the night. Melatonin controls the functional activity of the mammalian PT by acting upon MT1 melatonin receptors. The PT sends its output signals via retrograde and anterograde pathways. The retrograde pathway targetting the hypothalamus employs TSH as messenger and controls a local hypothalamic T3 system. As discovered in Japanese quail, TSH triggers molecular cascades mediating thyroid hormone conversion in the ependymal cell layer of the infundibular recess of the third ventricle. The local accumulation of T-3 in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) appears to activate the gonadal axis by affecting the neuro-glial interaction between GnRH terminals and tanycytes in the median eminence. This retrograde pathway is conserved in photoperiodic mammals (sheep and hamsters), and even in non-photoperiodic laboratory mice provided that they are capable to synthesize melatonin. The anterograde pathway is implicated in the control of prolactin secretion, targets cells in the PD and supposedly employs small molecules as signal substances collectively denominated as ""tuberalins"". Several ""tuberalin"" candidates have been proposed, such as tachykinins, the secretory protein TAFA and endocannabinoids (EC). The PT -intrinsic EC system was first demonstrated in Syrian hamsters and shown to respond to photoperiodic changes. Subsequently, the EC system was also demonstrated in the PT of mice, rats and humans. To date, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) appears as the most important endocannabinoid from the PT. Likely targets for the EC are folliculo-stellate cells that contain the CB1 receptor and appear to contact lactotroph cells. The CB1 receptor was also found on corticotroph cells which appear as a further target of the EC. Recently, the CB1 receptor was also localized to CRF-containing nerve fibers running in the outer zone of the median eminence. This finding suggests that the EC system of the PT contributes not only to the anterograde, but also to the retrograde pathway. Taken together, the results support the concept that the PT transmits its signals via a ""cocktail"" of messenger molecules which operate also in other brain areas and systems rather than through PT-specific ""tuberalins"". Furthermore, they may attribute a novel function to the PT, namely the modulation of the stress response and immune functions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Sustainable harvest management implies an ability to control harvest rates. This is challenging in systems that have limited control of resources and resource users, which is often the case in small game harvest management. The difference - between management strategies and actual harvest bag size (i.e. implementation uncertainty) may be substantial, but few studies have explored this. 2. We investigated how different management strategies and ecosystem variables affected realised harvest of willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus L.) among nine independently managed, state-owned hunting areas in Central and South Norway during 2008-2015. First, we focused our empirical analysis around three response variables of interest: hunting bag (scaled by area), hunting effort (number of hunting days scaled by area) and hunter efficiency (shot birds per hunting day). Akaike information criteria (AIC) guided model selection among candidate GLMMs. Then, we used model-averaged parameter estimating from the statistical models in numerical simulations to explore risk of overharvest due to implementation uncertainty. 3. The most parsimonious model explaining hunting bag included total allowable catch (TAC) and willow ptarmigan density. Hunting effort was explained by number of permits sold and type of quota (daily vs. weekly quota). The most parsimonious model describing hunter efficiency only included the effect of willow ptarmigan density. 4. Our results show that managers have only partial control over harvest rates in this system, and that hunters were relatively more efficient and harvest rates higher at low densities. This effect was present for all management strategy scenarios, -including when managers adjusted TAC according to population estimates from monitoring programmes. 5. Synthesis and applications. Quantifying risk of unsustainable harvest rates under different scenarios enables managers to make informed decisions, when dealing with competing objectives of harvest opportunities and sustainability. The substantial risk of high harvest rates at low densities reported here should encourage frequent use of threshold strategies. This study is one of the first approaches for quantifying implementation uncertainty in small game harvest, and shows how estimates from empirical analyses could be used to quantify risk of overharvest.";"grouse; harvest rates; hunter efficiency; hunting effort; implementation uncertainty; management strategy; scenarios; small game; sustainable exploitation; willow ptarmigan";2018;"JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY";"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Various mechanisms, including ecological constraints, energetic constraints, diversification rate (DivRate) variation, time-for-speciation effect and multiple colonizations, have been posited to explain this pattern. We used pheasants (Aves: Phasianidae) as a model group to test these hypotheses and to understand the ecological and evolutionary processes that have generated the extraordinary diversity in these mountains. LocationSino-Himalayas and adjacent regions. TaxonPheasants. MethodsUsing distribution maps predicted by species distribution models (SDMs) and a time-calibrated phylogeny for pheasants, we examined the relationships between species richness and predictors including net primary productivity (NPP), niche diversity (NicheDiv), DivRate, evolutionary time (EvolTime) and colonization frequency using Pearson's correlations and structural equationmodelling (SEM). We reconstructed ancestral ranges at nodes and examined basal/derived species patterns to reveal the mechanisms underlying species richness gradients in the Sino-Himalayas. ResultsWe found that ancestral pheasants originated in Africa in the early Oligocene (similar to 33Ma), and then colonized the Sino-Himalayan mountains and other regions. In the Sino-Himalayas, species richness was strongly related to DivRate, NPP, NicheDiv and colonization frequency, but weakly correlated with EvolTime. The direct effects of NicheDiv and DivRate on richness were stronger than NPP and EvolTime. NPP indirectly influenced species richness via DivRate, but its effect on richness via NicheDiv was relatively weak. Main conclusionsHigher species diversity in the Sino-Himalayas was generated by both ecological and evolutionary mechanisms. An increase in available niches, rapid diversifications and multiple colonizations was found to be key direct processes for the build-up of the diversity hotspots of pheasants in the Sino-Himalayan mountains. Productivity had an important but indirect effect on species richness, which worked through increased DivRate.

It is unknown how the puma (Puma concolor) selects and uses resources, what environmental factors determine its presence and how this species is affected by natural disturbances in Mexican tropical forests. This study was performed in the Eden ecological reserve and surroundings, in the North of Quintana Roo, Mexico, an area dominated by tropical semideciduous (medium forest) and secondary forest (acahual). Camera samplings were carried out during 2008, and from 2010 to 2012. Habitat variables, activity patterns and species associations were also spatially and temporally analyzed using achi-squared test and overlapping coefficients.

Cougars used vegetation and paths in different proportions as the availability of these resources. The years with more changes (P < 0.05) were 2008 and 2011. This predator was active throughout the day, but changed its activity patterns over the years.

After testing 90 GLM models, the model with a lower AIC value described the activity patterns of prey and co-predators. The vegetation and water in the reserve were important variables for the cougar.

Concurrent with advances in biotelemetry devices, development of home range estimator methods incorporating the temporal component of locational fixes are increasingly used to investigate these patterns at finer scales. However, these methods may necessitate sampling schedules that limit battery life and study period length. Practically, evaluating how home range estimator methods affect calculations of space use and habitat selection prior to deployment of biotelemetry devices could help researchers optimize data acquisition schedules. We quantified spatial overlap between a home range estimator using temporal information (dynamic Brownian bridge movement model [dBBMM]) and home range estimators not incorporating the temporal component of fixes (ad hoc and href kernel density estimator [KDE]) across differing sample schedules, and the resulting error in habitat selection ratios using data collected from wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) equipped with Global Positioning Systems units in Texas, Georgia, South Carolina, and Louisiana, USA, during February-May 2015. When comparing ranges created from KDEs to dBBMM, commission errors were large (20-80%) and did not diminish with increased sampling rates. In contrast, omission error rate declined quicker and improvements were minimal when fix rates increased beyond 4/day. Compared with ranges estimated with dBBMM, KDEs poorly defined the spatial bearings of an individual's range, overestimated areas of use, underestimated areas avoided, and showed different patterns of habitat selection. Our results suggest home range estimator methods incorporating temporal information seem capable of estimating ranges encompassing nearly all area used by an individual and should be used even at relatively low-frequency collection schedules to assess home ranges of wild turkeys. If researchers are interested in describing habitat selection of wild turkeys, we recommend a sampling schedule of <= 1 location/hour during daytime and dBBMM for range estimation.

Tail-mounted transmitters are dropped or shed when the rectrices molt, which may reduce transmitter effects while providing retention times sufficient for most research objectives. However, retention times of tail-mounted transmitters for birds are insufficiently described, and bias from not following all birds until transmitters are shed has been ignored. We studied transmitter retention of 106 birds of 6 species in the United States of America, 2010-2013, using direct observations and survival modeling based on radiotelemetry tracking. Cox proportional hazard survival models predicted median transmitter retention times from 4 to 53 days, depending on species. Our results suggest that researchers should anticipate premature (i.e., <30 days) tag loss rates from 15% to 38% for adult birds, and adjust permit and funding applications accordingly. However, predicted premature tag loss approached 100% for independent juvenile birds, which frequently appeared to disperse long distances, leading to few or no failure events to inform models.

Accordingly, a variety of techniques are used to reduce the impact of nest predation on listed species. We examined the efficacy of conditioned taste aversion, a nonlethal technique designed to induce avoidance behavior in predators after being exposed to prey items that have been treated, usually with a chemical emetic that causes predators to become ill within minutes of consumption. We used carbachol (carbamyl choline chloride) as a taste-aversive agent to condition corvids responsible for high levels of nest predation on 2 federally listed species-the western snowy plover (Charadrius nivosus nivosus) and California least tern (Sternula antillarum browni)-breeding at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California, USA. We conducted 2 separate experiments in 2013 and 2014, during which we deployed 772 artificial nests during the first experiment and 760 artificial nests during the second experiment. Each artificial nest contained 3 quail (Coturnix spp.) eggs. During the first stage of both experiments all of the nests only contained untreated quail eggs, and nest predation was high with >90% of nests failing within 1-2 days of deployment. In subsequent stages, we deployed carbachol-treated eggs in increasing proportion. We used nest survival models to evaluate daily survival rates (DSR) of artificial nests in all stages of both experiments. During both experiments, DSR increased concomitant with a greater proportion of carbachol-treated eggs. Common ravens (Corvus corax) accounted for 98.1% (n = 471) of all artificial nest predations in Experiment 1, and 95.6% (n = 498) of all artificial nest predations in Experiment 2. Using carbachol as a taste-aversive agent was effective at reducing predation on artificial nests as illustrated by increased DSR (0.47 to 0.98 in the first experiment and 0.00 to 0.99 in the second experiment); however, transferability of this technique to plover and tern nests was not fully realized.

Changing climate will likely have strong effects on arid environments as a result of increased temperatures, increasing frequency and intensity of droughts, and less consistent pulses of rainfall. Therefore, understanding the link between patterns of precipitation, temperature, and population performance of species occupying these environments will continue to increase in importance as climatic shifts occur within these natural ecosystems. We sought to evaluate how individual, maternal, population, and environmental, particularly temperature and precipitation, level factors influence population performance of a large herbivore in an arid environment. We used mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) as a representative species and quantified juvenile survival to test hypotheses about effects of environmental factors on population performance. Precipitation events occurring in mid- to late-pregnancy (January-April) leading to spring green-up, as indexed by normalized difference in vegetation index, had the strongest positive effect on juvenile survival and recruitment. In addition, larger neonates had an increased probability of survival. Our findings indicate that timing and amount of precipitation prior to parturition have strong influences on maternal nutritional condition, which was passed on to young.

There has also been no widespread introduction of a dustbathing material for broilers. The main aim of this trial was to evaluate the use of a dustbathing substrate (in the form of oat hulls), both as an alternative to straw bales and as a supplementary enrichment. Over four replicates, four commercial houses, each containing approximately 22,000 broilers, were assigned to one of four treatments over the 6-week production cycle: (1) straw bales (B; one per 155 m(2)), (2) oat hulls as a dustbathing substrate (OH; provided in 1 m diameter steel rings, one per 155 m(2)), (3) both oat hulls and straw bales (OH + B), and (4) a control treatment with no environmental enrichment (C). Observations of broiler behaviour and leg health were taken weekly, and performance data was collected for each cycle. Broilers housed in the OH and OH + B treatments had better gait scores in week 6 than those housed in the C treatment (P < 0.05), which suggests that the provision of oat hulls improved bird leg health. However, there was no associated increase in activity levels in unenriched areas of the houses. Conversely, more locomotion (P < 0.001), less sitting inactive (P < 0.001) and less sitting pecking (P < 0.001) were observed in the C treatment than in unenriched areas of B, OH and OH + B treatments. More birds were recorded around the bales compared to the oat hulls (P < 0.001), however birds performed significantly more foraging (P = 0.019) and dustbathing (P = 0.045) in oat hulls than around straw bales. Although oat hulls appear to be more suitable for stimulating active behaviours than straw bales, the high level of resting recorded around the bales suggests they may have a positive function as protective cover. The presence of an additional type of enrichment in the house did not affect the number of birds, or the type of behaviours performed in close proximity to either straw bales or oat hulls (P > 0.05). Treatment did not have a significant effect on pododermatitis levels or slaughter weight, on mortality rates, or on litter quality or atmospheric ammonia levels (P > 0.05). Overall, our results suggest that the oat hulls substrate was a successful enrichment in terms of promoting dustbathing and foraging, and improving bird leg health.

Gunnison sage-grouse (Centrocercus minimus) represents one such species in need of large-scale habitat restoration. It is a federally threatened sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) obligate bird with a limited range in Colorado and Utah. Threats to recovery of Gunnison sage-grouse include conifer expansion into sagebrush along with additional habitat loss and degradation attributed to human development and agricultural conversion. Recovery of Gunnison sage-grouse and other sensitive species can be aided by spatial tools that forecast plausible outcomes of conservation actions. We illustrate this by using a novel framework for predicting outcomes of proactive tree removal and subsequent sagebrush restoration for the Gunnison sage-grouse. To assess threats on Gunnison sage-grouse lek presence, we developed a spatially explicit breeding habitat model to compare active lek and random pseudo-absence locations from 2015. Models identified land cover, climatic, and abiotic variables at landscape-level scales (0.56 and 4 km) most important for predicting breeding habitat. Our model correctly differentiated between lek and pseudo-absence locations 94% of the time. All but one of the active leks (n = 94) were in areas with >0.65 probability of lek occurrence. Using this probability value as a threshold, we predicted 15% of the current grouse range as high-quality breeding habitat. Simulated removal of trees in areas with <= 30% tree canopy cover (0.56-km scale) increased extent of high-quality habitat fourfold (59%). Hypothetical restoration of sagebrush cover in the same areas increased habitat quality an additional 11%. Our breeding habitat model indicated that targeted tree removal and sagebrush restoration have potential to improve Gunnison sage-grouse breeding habitat. While our habitat treatment scenarios were not meant to be prescriptive, they highlight that considerable uplift in Gunnison sage-grouse breeding habitat may be possible across much of its range with cooperation from multiple stakeholders and illustrates the utility of this approach for predicting biological return on investment.";"Centrocercus minimus; Colorado; conifer expansion; habitat restoration; habitat selection; lek occurrence; juniper; pinyon pine; Utah";2018;"ECOSPHERE";"Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

However, such kind of optical spectroscopy requires a window in the egg shell, is thus invasive to the embryo and leads to decreased hatching rates. Here, we show that near infrared Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy can be performed on perfused extraembryonic vessels while leaving the inner egg shell membrane intact. Sparing the shell membrane makes the measurement minimally invasive, so that the sexing procedure does not affect hatching rates. We analyze the effect of the membrane above the vessels on fluorescence signal intensity and on Raman spectrum of blood, and propose a correction method to compensate for it. After compensation, we attain a correct sexing rate above 90% by applying supervised classification of spectra.

In this paper, I report the ongoing work to investigate numerical cognition in the day-old domestic chick (Gallus gallus). Unlike previous studies on adult animals, chicks can be tested very early in life, which gives us the opportunity to discover the origins of numerical comprehension. Here, I discuss studies revealing that day-old domestic chicks can: (i) discriminate between different numbers of objects; (ii) solve rudimentary arithmetic operations; and (iii) use ordinal information, identifying a target element (e.g. the fourth) in a series of identical elements, on the basis of its serial-numerical position. Some of these abilities are number-specific, while others underlie the interplay between number and continuous extents (continuous-quantity cues that covary with number, such as area and perimeter).

Understanding the relative role of top-down versus bottom-up drivers is of particular interest in understanding ecosystem dynamics. Our goal was to explore predator-prey relationships in a boreal ecosystem in interior Alaska through the use of multispecies long-term monitoring data. We used 29years of field data and a dynamic multistate site occupancy modeling approach to explore the trophic relationships between an apex predator, the golden eagle, and cyclic populations of the two primary prey species available to eagles early in the breeding season, snowshoe hare and willow ptarmigan. We found that golden eagle reproductive success was reliant on prey numbers, but also responded prior to changes in the phase of the snowshoe hare population cycle and failed to respond to variation in hare cycle amplitude. There was no lagged response to ptarmigan populations, and ptarmigan populations recovered quickly from the low phase. Together, these results suggested that eagle reproduction is largely driven by bottom-up processes, with little evidence of top-down control of either ptarmigan or hare populations. Although the relationship between golden eagle reproductive success and prey abundance had been previously established, here we established prey populations are likely driving eagle dynamics through bottom-up processes. The key to this insight was our focus on golden eagle reproductive parameters rather than overall abundance. Although our inference is limited to the golden eagle-hare-ptarmigan relationships we studied, our results suggest caution in interpreting predator-prey abundance patterns among other species as strong evidence for top-down control.";"bottom-up control; golden eagle; population dynamics; predator-prey; snowshoe hare; top-down control; willow ptarmigan";2018;"ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION";"Ecology; Evolutionary Biology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

However, the appropriate scale of protection depends on accompanying threats, such as predator attraction to the same aggregation sites, to which the target species may need to respond by moving to alternative habitat patches. We performed experiments using artificial ground nests around protected capercaillie leks in commerciallymanaged forest landscape in Estonia. We considered two scales: the landscape up to 3 km from the lek centre, and among 10-30-ha forest compartments, which differed in predator abundance. We found that nest predation significantly declined with distance from the lek. Nests were depredated by multiple mammalian and avian predator species and total predator abundance explained most of the between-forest variation in predation rate. Our results indicate that, in this hemiboreal area, (i) ground nest predation is largely determined by landscape-scale distribution of predators and (ii) predators can aggregate at capercaillie leks. The implication is that lek-centred habitat protection used for the capercaillie and other grouse may be ineffective unless the peripheral habitat quality and predator abundance are specifically addressed.

These attempts have resulted in high mortality rates, which we hypothesised are caused by captive-reared birds exhibiting more naive predator avoidance behaviour than wild birds. Captive-reared and wild-trapped Northern Bobwhites were subjected to raptorial and terrestrial predator simulations and their responses were recorded on high definition video. We recorded the time to predator detection, time to anti-predator defence, and reaction type for comparative analysis. Captive-reared birds detected simulated predators quicker than wild-trapped birds, but time to mount an anti-predator defence was not different between groups. The response type, however, was different between groups. Captive-reared birds typically flushed when encountering a simulated predator; yet, wild-trapped birds did not flush at all, and typically ran or held when subjected to the simulated predators. We hypothesise that flushing is a naive anti-predator response that results in revealing of position in the presence of a threat, thereby increasing the individual risk of predation.

We studied the effects of wind turbine noise on the boom, cackle, whine, and whoop vocalizations of male Greater Prairie-Chickens recorded at 14 leks located 703 m to 23 km away from a wind energy facility near Ainsworth, Brown County, Nebraska, USA, in 2013 and 2014. First, we assessed ambient sound levels at our study sites. Wind turbine noise contributed to the soundscape; leks <1,000 m from wind turbines had higher levels of ambient sound than expected on the basis of recordings obtained at remote locations. Our second objective was to determine whether the acoustic characteristics of the 4 vocalizations recorded near the wind energy facility differed from those recorded farther away. At leks within 1,000 m of the wind energy facility, boom and whoop sound pressure levels were higher (boom 2% higher; whoop 5% higher), boom duration was 3% shorter, whine fundamental frequency was 11% higher, and biphonations in cackle vocalizations occurred 15% less often. These differences suggest that male Greater Prairie-Chickens adjust the acoustic properties of their vocalizations in response to the sounds generated by turbines at wind energy facilities.

Model based analyses are well suited to rapidly identifying and evaluating alternative actions but often lack explicit linkages between habitat conditions and population outcomes. We provide an example of how spatially explicit population modeling can uniquely inform conservation planning by integrating changes in habitat conditions with population responses. Using a case study of the critically endangered Greater Sage-grouse in Canada, we integrated habitat selection maps, demography and demographic risk maps, movement, and behavior into a predictive individual-based modeling framework. We used this framework to simulate population dynamics, evaluate demographic sensitivities, assess source-sink dynamics, and compared the population gains from restoring different types (strengths) of sinks. Sensitivity analysis results underscored the need for multiple, simultaneous population recovery actions to stabilize the population, including improving chick and adult survival. Strong source-sink dynamics were an emergent property of simulations, driven by the maladaptive selection of habitats with low chick survival and nest success. Simulated habitat restorations improving chick survival conditions in strong sinks were more effective at increasing abundance than actions targeting all sinks, or removing sinks. Spatially explicit population modeling can be an informative means of predicting and comparing potential population responses to habitat restoration and population recovery options. Individual based modeling can uniquely evaluate habitat-population dynamics and can be particularly useful for critically endangered species, when too few animals or time remains to conduct field experiments.";"Greater Sage-grouse; Canada; Spatially explicit individual-based model; Habitat restoration; Population recovery; Source-sink dynamics";2018;"BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION";"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

However, immune responses are costly and individuals must trade-off their immune response with other fitness components (e.g. survival or reproductive success) meaning that individuals with intermediate response may have the greatest overall fitness. Such a process might be particularly acute in species with strong sexual selection because the condition-dependence of male secondary sexual-traits might lead to striking phenotypic differences amongst males of different immune response levels. We tested whether there is selection on immune response by survival and reproduction in yearling and adult male black grouse (Lyrurus tetrix) following an immune challenge with a novel antigen and tested the hypothesis that sexual signals and body mass are honest signals of the immune response. We show that yearling males with highest immune response to these challenges had higher survival, but the reverse was true for adults. Adults with higher responses had highest mass loss and adult males with intermediate immune response had highest mating success. Tail length was related to baseline response in adults and more weakly in yearlings. Our findings reveal the complex fitness consequences of mounting an immune response across age classes. Such major differences in the direction and magnitude of selection in multiple fitness components is an alternative route underpinning the stabilising selection of immune responses with an intermediate immune response being optimal.";"Ecological immunology; ELISA; Immunocompetance; Life history theory; Stabilising selection";2018;"OECOLOGIA";"Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We trapped lesser prairie-chickens on leks and marked them with either global positioning system (GPS) satellite or very high frequency (VHF) transmitters to estimate survival and home-range size during the nonbreeding season.

However, because of its association with ciguatera fish poisoning, it is rarely fished for food. Previous research indicates that roi could have a negative impact on native reef fish assemblages because of their high densities and prey consumption rates. However, it is unclear whether roi add to the cumulative mortality of prey (predation hypothesis), or whether predation is instead compensatory (doomed surplus hypothesis). This study experimentally assessed the effects of roi on reef fish populations through a long-term (5.5 year) predator removal experiment. A Before-After-Control-Impact study design was used to assess changes in fish assemblages following the removal of roi on 1.3 ha of patch reef. Increases in the density of prey-sized fish (< 15 cm TL) were observed 18 months after roi removal. However, those effects did not translate into sustained increases in prey. While increases in potential competitors, wrasses (family Labridae), particularly the piscivorous ringtail wrasse Oxycheilinus unifasciatus, were observed on roi-free reefs, the fish assemblage did not diverge substantially in composition. Native reef fish appeared to resist the potential negative impacts of predation by roi, possibly through a refuge in size for some fish families. Management to protect intact fish assemblage size-structure could serve to bolster native resistance to invading species. In considering the threats facing coral reefs, and the possible solutions, roi removal alone will not likely replenish native fishery resources.";"Introduced species; Predator removal experiment; Mesopredator; Doomed surplus; Biotic resistance; Hawaii";2018;"ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES";"Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We built on previous work by using empirical data to examine the position of recent local extinctions within species' geographic ranges, address range position as a continuum, and explore the influence of environmental factors. We aggregated point-locality data for 125 Galliform species from across the Palearctic and Indo-Malaya into equal-area half-degree grid cells and used a multispecies dynamic Bayesian occupancy model to estimate rates of local extinctions. Our model provides a novel approach to identify loss of populations from within species ranges. We investigated the relationship between extinction rates and distance from range edge by examining whether patterns were consistent across biogeographic realm and different categories of land use. In the Palearctic, local extinctions occurred closer to the range edge than range core in both unconverted and human-dominated landscapes. In Indo-Malaya, no pattern was found for unconverted landscapes, but in human-dominated landscapes extinctions tended to occur closer to the core than the edge.

The causes of lead ammunition ingestion in Bonelli's eagle (Aquila fasciata) and its effects on breeding success were studied in one of the most important populations of this endangered species in Europe. Regurgitated pellets belonging to different pairs from 2004 to 2014 were analyzed, both in the breeding (1363 pellets from 12 territories) and non-breeding (172 pellets from 9 territories) seasons. From these territories, 57 molted feathers to study lead contamination were analyzed, and breeding success was monitored for 41 breeding attempts. The occurrence of lead shots in pellets was detected using X-ray photographs. Pellets were also used to describe eagle diet. Lead shots in pellets were present in 83.3% of the territories. The frequency of occurrence of lead shots in pellets (2.81% in spring and 1.31% in autumn) was primarily related to the consumption of red-legged partridge in the breeding season (when partridges are hunted from blinds using calling lures), and secondarily to rabbit consumption in the non-breeding season (coinciding with the main hunting season). Thus, our results indicate that injured small-game were the main source of lead contamination in the Bonelli's eagle. For the first time for a raptor species, a positive relationship between the frequency of occurrence of lead shots in pellets and lead concentration in eagles' feathers has been documented. Lead concentration in feathers (mean +/- SD: 816 +/- 426 mu g kg(-1), with no sex-related differences) was high for a species that rarely eats carrion or aquatic birds ( the main prey-related lead source for raptors). This had negative effects on breeding success, which could jeopardize Bonelli's eagles in other European populations that are sustained by juvenile dispersal from the study population. Our work shows that some game modalities pose a potential threat to endangered raptors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Our aim was to understand how this species is adapting to new farming practices and climate change. Our results suggest that increases in temperature and decreases in precipitation modify quail phenology. In hot years, an advance in mean arrival dates and stay stages but a delay in departure dates was found. However, in rainy years a delay in the mean start of the stay stage occurred. In cloudy areas, our findings show that quails advance their stay periods in hot and dry years and delay them in cold and rainy years. Accordingly, quail movements and breeding attempts are eco-synchronized sequentially in cloudy regions. Our results suggest that quails attempt to overcome the negative impacts of climate change and agricultural intensification by searching for alternative high-quality habitats. This strategy could explain how quail populations maintain viable and sustainable populations despite being legally harvested with regulated hunting. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Elevated temperatures led to an increase in cloacal temperature and a reduction in the proportion of sperm with normal morphology; these effects were most notable under 40 degrees C conditions, and were influenced by the duration of heat exposure and prior exposure to high temperature. Our findings highlight the potential role of temperature in determining male fertility in birds, and perhaps also in constraining the timing of avian breeding.

However, its structure and localization within the retina has remained unknown. Here, we sequenced night-migratory European robin (Erithacus rubecula) Cry4 from the retina and predicted the currently unresolved structure of the erCry4 protein, which suggests that erCry4 should bind Flavin. We also found that Cry1a, Cry1b, and Cry2 mRNA display robust circadian oscillation patterns, whereas Cry4 shows only a weak circadian oscillation. When we compared the relative mRNA expression levels of the cryptochromes during the spring and autumn migratory seasons relative to the non-migratory seasons in European robins and domestic chickens (Gallus gallus), the Cry4 mRNA expression level in European robin retinae, but not in chicken retinae, is significantly higher during the migratory season compared to the non-migratory seasons.

Mrapl mRNA could be detected in adrenal tissue, but not in any of the other tissues, and mrap2 mRNA was also detected in the adrenal gland. Finally, all five melanocortin receptors mRNAs could be detected in the adrenal gland; mc2r and mc5r mRNAs were the most abundant. To evaluate any potential interactions between MRAP1 and the MCR5 that may occur in adrenal cells, individual chick mcr cDNA constructs were transiently expressed in CHO cells either in the presence or absence of a chick mrapl cDNA, and the transfected cells were stimulated with hACTH(124) at concentrations ranging from 10(-13) M to 10(-6) M. As expected, MC2R required co-expression with MRAP1 for functional expression; whereas, co-expression of cMC3R with cMRAP1 had no statistically significant effect on sensitivity to hACTH(1-24). However, co-expression of MC4R and MC5R with MRAP1, increased sensitivity for ACfH(1-24) by approximately 35 fold and 365 fold, respectively. However, co-expressing of cMRAP2 with these melanocortin receptors had no effect on sensitivity to hACTH(1-24). Since the real-time PCR analysis detected mrap2 mRNA and mc4r mRNA in the hypothalamus, the interaction between cMC4R and cMRAP2 with respect to sensitivity to ACTH(1-13)NH2 stimulation was also evaluated. However, no effect, either positive or negative, was observed. Finally, the highest levels of mc5r mRNA were detected in liver cells. This observation raises the possibility that in one-day old chicks, activation of the HPA axis may also involve a physiological response from liver tells. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Both strains displayed a common set of intermale aggressive behaviors that included pecking, grabbing, mounting, and cloacal contact behavior, although NIES-Brn quail showed significantly more grabbing, mounting, and cloacal contact behavior than did NIES-L quail. We examined sex hormone levels in the blood and diencephalon in both strains. Testosterone concentrations were significantly higher in the blood and diencephalon of NIES-Brn quail compared to NIES-L quail. We next examined gene expression in the hypothalamus of both strains using an Agilent gene expression microarray and real-time RT-PCR and found that gene expression of mesotocin (an oxytocin homologue) was significantly higher in the hypothalamus of NIES-Brn quail compared to NIES-L quail. Immunohistochemistry of the hypothalamus revealed that numbers of large cells (cell area > 500 mu m(2)) expressing mesotocin were significantly higher in the NIES-Brn strain compared to the NIES-L strain.

Neonicotinoid use was significantly (p<0.05) negatively associated with bobwhite abundance in the High Plains, Rolling Plains, Gulf Coast Prairies & Marshes, Edwards Plateau, and South Texas Plains ecological regions in the time periods following neonicotinoid introduction (1994-2003) or after their widespread use (2004-2012). Our analyses suggest that the use of neonicotinoid insecticides may negatively affect bobwhite populations in crop-producing regions of Texas.";NA;2018;"PLOS ONE";"Multidisciplinary Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Previously regarded as monophyletic, the two evolutionarily distant clades are now divided into five genera. Questions considered were whether chick plumage supports the dichotomy between spurfowls and francolins and what role habitat matching plays. Methods: The study was based mainly on photographs of chick skins from the American Museum of Natural History and the Natural History Museum at Tring. Eight plumage characters were selected for comparative scoring, summarised in a matrix. These characters were subsequently analysed phylogenetically and their evolution was traced on the existing molecular phylogeny using a parsimony approach. Results: Based on chick plumage the phylogeny of species groups among francolins and spurfowls, was largely unresolved possibly ascribed to a high degree of symplesiomorphy inherent among the Phasianids. This possibly could have resulted in a high degree of polytomy particularly among the spurfowls and francolins. Furthermore, the ancestral state reconstructions revealed high prevalence of symplesiomorphic states and reversals which do not help in the classification of groups. Although the differences are described that separate some African francolins from spurfowls, other francolins (in Asia and Africa) share remarkably similar characteristics with spurfowls. Plain dark dorsal plumage is probably advantageous for avoiding detection by predators in forests, while facial stripes optimise the breaking of body shapes in dense grass cover (as in Scleroptila spp.) and semi-striped faces are advantageous for stationary camouflage under tree and bush cover (as in Pternistis spp.). Conclusions: Although symplesiomorphy is a hereditary explanation for downy colours and patterns, the traits relevant for habitat matching are combined in a manner which is determined (adaptation) by natural selection.";"Spurfowl; Francolin; Phasianidae; Chick plumage; Phylogeny; Ancestral state reconstruction; Habitat";2018;"AVIAN RESEARCH";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Identifying opportunities to align social and environmental needs is thus a transdisciplinary design challenge. To meet this task, we present the concept of spatiotemporal multifunctionality (i.e. the provisioning of more than one human or environmental function in a given place at different times) and demonstrate how integrating principles of landscape ecology, social-ecological systems, and land system architecture enables a dynamic approach to landscape design and planning. Such an integration is capable of providing conservation tools for diverse social-ecological systems to maximize spatiotemporal multifunctionality.

Among vertebrates, birds have evolved highly sophisticated mechanisms for seasonal reproduction to accommodate their adaptation for flight. For example, the mass of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) testes increases more than 100-fold within a few weeks. Under short-day conditions, gonadal development is suppressed and testes retain their immature size. However, when quail are transferred to long-day conditions, germ cell differentiation begins immediately. Conversely, when they are transferred to winter conditions (short day and low temperature), arrested meiosis and germ cell apoptosis cause rapid testicular regression. Recent molecular analysis revealed the signal transduction pathway regulating seasonal reproduction. Comparative analysis of seasonal reproduction in various species also revealed both the similarity (i.e., signal transduction machineries) and diversity (i.e., responsible cells or organs) of these mechanisms among various vertebrate species.";"Seasonal reproduction; Photoperiodism; Thyroid hormone; Thyrotropin";2018;"REPRODUCTIVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL STRATEGIES: THE CONTINUITY OF LIFE";"Developmental Biology; Reproductive Biology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The properties and appearance of eggshells are important for successful breeding both for birds kept in captivity and in breeding centres and those living in their natural environment. The presented study focuses on the association between the pigmentation, maculation and eggshell thickness of Western Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) kept in captivity. The eggs were collected during the entire egg-laying season in order to determine the factors which influence eggshell pigmentation and thickness across the laying period. We found that at the equator surface the lightest eggs had a tendency to be thinner than the darkest ones. In addition, eggshells with a smooth pattern were thinner at the equator, especially when compared to the mottled ones. There was no statistically significant association between the eggshell overall lightness (eggshell pigmentation except the concentrated pigment spots), maculation and eggshell thickness at the blunt and sharp ends of the eggshell. Eggshells were on average 5.5% thicker at spots than in other areas. The obtained results suggest that the spot pigment forms an additional layer on the Capercaillie eggshell and does not compensate for the loss of thickness, as observed in some bird species (Passeriformes, Falconiformes). A negative association between the eggshell thickness and the laying date (comparing eggs laid in April and June) was also observed., despite the availability of a variety of food and ad libitum calcium supplementation during the entire reproductive season. The eggshell coloration was not related to the period of egg-laying. We have shown the effect of pigmentation on one of the most important parameters of eggshell quality, shell thickness. In the case of Capercaillie, the places of eggshell thinning are not related to concentrated pigment spots. This suggests that the pigment deposition and its role may be different from other bird orders (Charadriiformes, Falconiformes, Passeriformes).";NA;2018;"ORNIS FENNICA";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Methods: We develop area-interaction models using a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator penalty to explore the distribution of 102 Hen Harrier nest sites in relation to habitat and topography. Our model is then successfully validated in tests using data for 70 nest sites from subsequent years. Results: Our model is effective in predicting suitable areas for Hen Harrier nest sites and indicates that Hen Harriers on Mull are found in habitat mosaics below 200 m above sea level. Hen Harrier nest intensity is positively associated with increasing proportions of moorland and scrub, open canopy forestry and closed canopy forestry. Nest intensity is negatively associated with increasing proportions of grazed land. Conclusion: Hen Harriers avoid grazed areas but are relatively tolerant of other habitat combinations. These findings are supported by previous observations of Hen Harrier habitat use and have implications for the recovery of some Hen Harrier populations in Special Protection Areas and future forest management.

We compared daily nest survival estimates of killdeer Charadrius vociferous at graveled oil pads to those that nested on native grass cover in western Oklahoma, USA in 2015 and 2017. We conducted weekly searches for nesting killdeer around oil pads and in pastures (grass cover) at the Packsaddle Wildlife Management Area April-June. Killdeer showed a strong selection for graveled oil pad over grass fields with 64% of all nest attempts occurring on oil pads. A higher proportion (64%) of the nests we found were in the gravel substrates of oil pads, and daily nest survival estimates for oil pad nests were lower than our estimates for nests in grass substrates. We also identified a difference in edge effects between the two nesting substrates with the probability of nest survival on oil pads highest closer to the edge of the patches and the probability of nest survival in grass cover highest in the interior of the patches. This is an indication that risk of nest failure on oil pads increased towards areas of high human use: Nest failure on oil pads was almost entirely due to destruction by moving vehicles and by oil workers performing routine operations at well sites.

We observed extremely high mortality rates early in the study and questioned if our global positioning systems (GPS) transmitters were negatively affecting survival of adult greater sage-grouse. Thus, in situ we captured and randomly assigned additional grouse to either a GPS or VHF transmitter and examine patterns of mortality and estimated survival to evaluate if there were in fact transmitter effects on this important vital rate. Our results indicated that regardless of instrument type large wildfire had negative effects on monthly survival the first year after the fire. However, point estimates indicated that greater sage-grouse fitted with GPS transmitters had approximately 5% lower annual survival than VHF tagged birds, but although there was relatively large overlap in confidence limits, likely caused by small sample sizes.

As is evident throughout human harvest history, lack of coordinated management and monitoring at appropriate levels often leads to 'the tragedy of the commons', where shared populations suffer overexploitation. Effective management can also be hampered by poor understanding of the factors that limit and regulate migratory populations throughout their flyways, and over time. Following decades of population increase, some European duck populations now show signs of levelling off or even decline, underlining the need for more active and effective management. In Europe, the existing mechanisms for delivering effective management of duck populations are limited, despite the need and enthusiasm for establishing adaptive management (AM) schemes for wildlife populations. Existing international legal agreements already oblige European countries to sustainably manage migratory waterbirds. Although the lack of coordinated demographic and hunting data remains a challenge to sustainable management planning, AM provides a robust decision-making framework even in the presence of uncertainty regarding demographic and other information. In this paper we investigate the research and monitoring needs in Europe to successfully apply AM to ducks, and search for possible model species, focusing on freshwater species (in contrast to sea duck species) in the East Atlantic flyway. Based on current knowledge, we suggest that common teal Anas crecca, Eurasian wigeon Mareca penelope and common goldeneye Bucephala clangula represent the best species for testing the application of an AM muddling approach to duck populations in Europe.

In the study population the proportion of cocks at the beginning of the study period was only 23%. As hunting regulations for black grouse were tightened in the late 1970s the observed proportion of males showed an increase in particular during the first years but remained much lower than what would be expected from the sex ratio among chicks assuming equal survival between the sexes. The observed low proportion of adult males indicates a lower survival rate and as a consequence a smaller than natural lek size. High reproductive success two years before had a positive effect on lek size. The correlation coefficient between hunting bag and population size index increased with increasing hunting pressure and showed a decline over the years. Bag size in the period with a high hunting pressure (1981-1999, many hunting days) was driven by population density whereas in the second period (2000-2016, few hunting days) it was driven by hunting regulations. Our analysis showed that hunting affects population structure and presents indirect evidence that mortality due to hunting is additive.

We also aim to determine how Barn Swallow food abundance related to these habitats.Methods: Two foraging activity surveys took place on all grass and floristically enhanced margins (n=56) present within the 600 m foraging range of seven Barn Swallow colonies during June and July 2016. Margin habitat use was measured by recording the presence/absence of foraging individuals during surveys, the total number of individuals and by calculating an index of foraging activity. Habitat information relating to adjacent boundary type, transect crop type and neighbouring crop type were also recorded.Results: Foraging Barn Swallows were significantly more likely to be recorded when survey transects included a floristically enhanced margin, but there was no significant impact of floristically enhanced margins on the total number of individuals recorded or on the index of foraging activity. Foraging activity was higher along grass verges and hedgerows when compared to treelines and was positively related to length weighted Diptera abundance (a measure of food biomass).Conclusion: Our results suggest that there may be a role for floristically enhanced margins in the conservation of Barn Swallows on arable farmland.

Knowing key parameters and responses to observed changes can reduce the number of realistic management scenarios. In hunted species, survival might be the targeted parameter for effective plans. The red-legged partridge Alectoris rufa is a native species in Mediterranean countries. The species is hunted, especially in France where some release plans are implemented. However, survival estimates are scarce there and most studies were conducted in Spain. Here, we took advantage of a radio-tracking experiment in southern France (200 birds surveyed) to estimate monthly and annual survival rates of both wild and released red-legged partridge and to investigate the temporal, spatial and individual variations in survival. We found very high annual survival rate in our island site (0.70) and low survival elsewhere (range: 0.25-0.29). We showed that age and sex were a significant source of variation in annual survival of wild birds with lower estimates for young and for females. The close survival between mainland sites with different mortality sources suggests that compensation may occur between predation and hunting mortality. However, a stronger assessment of this point is needed. Our study suggests that environment characteristics, especially landscape mosaic and predation pressure, was a driver of survival. On the island site, the red-legged partridge shows a different demographic tactics (higher survival, lower reproduction) than in mainland, suggesting an adaptation to the context (lower predation). Regarding hand-reared birds released just before the hunting season, their survival to the next spring was lower than 0.05. Such a low value raises the issue of using release before the hunting season for reinforcement purpose, especially due to negative impact through the general increase in hunting pressure it promotes.

The study of the prevalence and diagnosis of bird ectoparasites on poultry farms with different maintenance technologies is important for the further development of integrated methods for combating them. Our research was conducted during 2006-2017 in 16 regions of Ukraine and the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. In total, 38 poultry farms specializing in egg production with poultry kept in battery cages, 18 poultry houses specializing in egg production with poultry kept on the floor and more than 150 farm and kitchen garden poultry houses for keeping chickens, turkeys, quails, guinea fowl and pigeons were examined. We found that, both with battery cages and when poultry are kept on the floor in poultry farms, the most common ectoparasites are chicken mites (Dermanyssus gallinae), which causes the disease of dermanyssiosis. It was determined that the extensivity of the invasion was, on average, from 56% to 80%. Also, in the chickens and turkeys, mallophages (Menopon gallinae, Menacanthus stramineus), which cause mallophagoses, were detected, and the extensivity of the invasion ranged from 27% to 45%. In farms and kitchen gardens where chickens, guinea fowl and quails were kept, the number of chicken mites in 1 g substrate was more than a thousand live mites, in dovecotes chicken mites were found in 50% to 100% of nests. In chickens and turkeys, besides the chicken mite, bird lice were found. In chickens, extensivity of invasion of M. gallinae, M. stramineus, Lipeurus variabilis, ranged from 15% to 22%, in turkeys, extensivity of invasion of M. gallinae and M. stramineus ranged from 16% to 25%. The scaly leg mite (Knemidocoptes mutans), which causes the disease knemidocoptiasis (""lame leg""), was detected in incubating hens over the age of two years, the extensivity of the invasion ranged from 5% to 7%. It was established that in poultry farms, both in battery cages and when the birds were kept on the floor, the main ectoparasite in chickens, guinea fowl and quail is red chicken mite (D. gallinae), and on poultry farms and kitchen gardens in addition to the chicken mite, three types of bird lice (M. gallinae, M. stramineus, L. variabilis) and K. mutans were found.";"red chicken mite; pulmonary diseases; dermanyssiosis; mallophages; knemidocoptiasis";2018;"BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY";"Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide may increase water use efficiency and productivity of some species. In many cases, increasing wildfire frequency and extent will be damaging for big sagebrush and other shrub species that are readily killed by fire. The widespread occurrence of cheatgrass and other nonnatives facilitates frequent fire through annual fuel accumulation. Shrub species that sprout following fire may be quite resilient to increased disturbance, but may be outcompeted by more drought tolerant species over time. Adaptation strategies for rangeland vegetation focus on increasing resilience of rangeland ecosystems, primarily through non-native species control and prevention. Ecologically based non-native plant management focuses on strategies to repair damaged ecological processes that facilitate invasion, and seeding of desired natives can be done where seed availability and dispersal of natives are low. Proactive management to prevent establishment of non-native species is also critical (early detection-rapid response), including tactics such as weed-free policies, education of employees and the public, and collaboration among multiple agencies to control weeds.

Therefore, projected climate change effects must be inferred from what is known about habitat characteristics and the autecology of each species. Habitat for mammals, including predators (Canada lynx, fisher, wolverine) and prey (snowshoe hare) that depend on high-elevation, snowy environments, is expected to deteriorate relatively soon if snowpack continues to decrease. Species that are highly dependent on a narrow range of habitat (pygmy rabbit, Brewer's sparrow, greater sage-grouse) will be especially vulnerable if that habitat decreases from increased disturbance (e.g., sagebrush mortality from wildfire). Species that are mobile or respond well to increased disturbance and habitat patchiness (deer, elk) will probably be resilient to a warmer climate in most locations. Some amphibian species (Columbia spotted frog, western toad) may be affected by pathogens (e.g., amphibian chytrid fungus) that are favored by a warmer climate. Adaptation strategies for wildlife focused on maintaining adequate habitat and healthy wildlife populations, and increasing knowledge of species' needs and climate sensitivities. Connectivity is an important conservation strategy for most species in the Northern Rockies. Maintaining healthy American beaver populations will provide riparian habitat structure and foraging opportunities for multiple species. Quaking aspen habitat, which is also important for several species, can be enhanced by allowing wildfire to burn, protecting aspen from grazing, and reducing conifer encroachment. Restoration of more open stands of ponderosa pine and mixed conifer forest through reduction of stand densities will benefit species such as flammulated owl. Excluding fire and reducing nonnative species will maintain sagebrush habitats that are required by several bird and mammal species.";"Wildlife; Climate change; Adaptation; Northern Rockies; Fisher; Pygmy rabbit; Brewer's sparrow; Deer; Elk; Columbia spotted frog; Western toad; Connectivity; American beaver; Lynx; Wolverine; Sage-grouse; Riparian; Wetland; Pelage change";2018;"CLIMATE CHANGE AND ROCKY MOUNTAIN ECOSYSTEMS";"Ecology; Environmental Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

One-thy-old male Arbor Acres broilers (n=420) were equally allotted to seven treatment groups: basal diet (control) group or basal diet with additional 0.1% Monensin or one kind of Chinese herbal medicine (Cynanchum atratum: CA; Radices Paeoniae alba: RPA; Morus alba L.: MAL; Astragalus membranaceus: AM, or Eucommia ulmoides Oliver: EUO). The results show that CA significantly increased the average weight gain and bursa index and decreased the average daily feed intake and feed/meat ratio (F/G) (P < 0.05), which was similar to that mediated by Monensin. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) concentration in kidney had a increasing tendency in the CA treatment group compared with control (P > 0.05). While MAL supplementation increased the F/G and decreased the survival rate and SOD levels in liver and kidney (P < 0.05).

Inter-and intraspecific habitat partitioning is widespread across taxa, yet limited information is available on differences in intraspecific habitat selection by same-sex individuals among differing reproductive states. Understanding habitat selection by conspecifics of different reproductive states may help optimise conservation efforts, particularly for gallinaceous bird species such as greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), which are long-lived but have only moderate reproductive rates. Aims. We predicted that habitat use differed between grouse under different reproductive states and that reproductive investment decreased survival of adults in summer. Methods. We compared habitat characteristics used by brood-rearing and broodless female sage-grouse and evaluated the influence of reproductive investment and habitat use on survival of adult females. Key results. We found that brood-rearing and broodless female sage-grouse partitioned habitat at micro- and macrohabitat scales. Broodless females were more likely to survive the summer. Conclusions. Our findings suggest reproductive state variability in habitat selection by female sage-grouse. Broodless females were roosting and foraging in concealed habitats with intermediate visual obstruction and annual vegetation productivity, but less food forb availability compared with early and late brood-rearing females. In contrast, brood-rearing females likely selected more herbaceous understoreys to predictably maximise foraging opportunities and promote growth of their chicks, which appeared to mitigate the influence of reproductive costs on summer survival, particularly during the late brood-rearing period.";"behavior; breeding status; reproduction";2018;"WILDLIFE RESEARCH";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

During recovery, while corticosterone and lymphoproliferation had recovered three days after the stressor ended, H/L and antibody responses required respectively nine and 12 days to recover to their basal levels, respectively.

The stronger the agreement from models that represent different processes and are based on distinct and independent sources of information, the greater the confidence we can have in their predictions. Evaluating the level of confidence is particularly important when predictions are used to guide conservation or restoration decisions. We used a multi-model approach to predict climate change impacts on big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), the dominant plant species on roughly 43 million hectares in the western United States and a key resource for many endemic wildlife species. To evaluate the climate sensitivity of A. tridentata, we developed four predictive models, two based on empirically derived spatial and temporal relationships, and two that applied mechanistic approaches to simulate sagebrush recruitment and growth. This approach enabled us to produce an aggregate index of climate change vulnerability and uncertainty based on the level of agreement between models. Despite large differences in model structure, predictions of sagebrush response to climate change were largely consistent. Performance, as measured by change in cover, growth, or recruitment, was predicted to decrease at the warmest sites, but increase throughout the cooler portions of sagebrush's range. A sensitivity analysis indicated that sagebrush performance responds more strongly to changes in temperature than precipitation. Most of the uncertainty in model predictions reflected variation among the ecological models, raising questions about the reliability of forecasts based on a single modeling approach. Our results highlight the value of a multimodel approach in forecasting climate change impacts and uncertainties and should help land managers to maximize the value of conservation investments.";"Artemisia; climate change; correlative models; model comparison; process-based models; sagebrush; vegetation change";2018;"GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY";"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We examined Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) den use by lemmings, their primary prey, in winter during a year of low lemming densities. We found winter nests, which are built by lemmings under snow, on 69% of fox dens, whereas no control sites had nests. In August, dens had twice the vegetation cover and 50% greater nitrogen content in grass than controls, suggesting soil enrichment by foxes increased food quantity and quality for herbivores. Snow was similar to 4 times thicker in April on dens than controls, and 1.4 times thicker on dens with lemming nests than dens without, suggesting lemmings choose thicker snow for thermal insulation. Snow cover thickness was positively related to vegetation cover on dens, but not on control sites. Thus, Arctic foxes not only prey on lemmings but also engineer productive habitat that attracts lemmings. During winters with low lemming densities, when foxes often leave the denning area and predation risk is lower, fox dens may provide a refuge that could buffer the effects of deteriorating snow conditions with Arctic warming. This additional mechanism of predators interacting with their prey illustrates how ecosystem engineers potentially alter food web interactions and highlights the importance of integrating these bodies of theory in attempts to understand community dynamics.";"Dicrostonyx richardsoni; food web; indirect interactions; nitrogen concentration; non-consumptive effects; snow depth; vegetation cover; vegetation quality; Vulpes lagopus";2018;"ECOSPHERE";"Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy of meso-mammal trap and removal (MMTR) at reducing meso-mammal activity and increasing bobwhite reproductive success; thus testing the predation limitation hypothesis. During 1999-2006, we monitored bobwhite reproduction on 11 sites in three states across the southeastern United States. Combined, there were 37 site-year combinations when MMTR occurred and 20 combinations when it did not occur. We conducted 57 predator surveys and calculated an index of meso-mammal activity (i.e. predator index), for each site, as the average number of station visits per night by raccoons Procyon lotor, nine-banded armadillos Dasypus novemcinctus, Virginia opossums Didelphis virginiana, bobcats Lynx rufus and foxes Vulpes vulpes, Urocyon cinereoargenteus. The average predator index (predator visits per trap night) across sites was 0.13. We collected bobwhite reproductive information from a total of 3935 radio-tagged bobwhites resulting in 2499 nests. We used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate the relationships between MMTR, predator activity, and bobwhite reproduction. The mean predator index for non-trapped sites was 0.21 (95% CLs: 0.18, 0.24) compared to 0.10 (95% CL: 0.07, 0.13) for trapped sites.

Little is known so far on the predation pressure on non-passerine nests in tall swards. Investigations on the interaction of land use with nesting site conditions and the habitat selection of nest predators are crucial to develop effective conservation measures for grassland birds. In this study, we used artificial nests baited with quail and plasticine eggs to identify potential predators of ground nests in floodplain meadows and related predation risk to vegetation structure and grassland management. Mean daily predation rate was 0.01 ( +/- 0.012) after an exposure duration of 21 days. 70% of all observed nest predations were caused by mammals (Red Fox and mustelids) and 17.5% by avian predators (corvids). Nest sites close to the meadow edge and those providing low forb cover were faced with a higher daily predation risk. Predation risk also increased later in the season. Land use in the preceding year had a significant effect on predation risk, showing higher predation rates on unmanaged sites than on mown sites. Unused meadows probably attract mammalian predators, because they provide a high abundance of small rodents and a more favourable vegetation structure for foraging, increasing also the risk of incidental nest predations.

Crested Francolin form male coalitions following the breeding season in May. Young males leave their natal coveys and join old males in these coalitions, which are not based on kinship and consist of up to nine members. These coalitions are joined by a young female from June to October, followed by the breeding season when pairs replace coalitions. The coalition is a prelude to successful mating. The single female calls in the coalition, which triggers a cacophony, and her presence often erupts in physical conflicts between males. This cacophony is interpreted as signal jamming where males prevent one another from forming a duet with the female, clearly showing competition between them for winning over the female for mating. A well-synchronised duet forms the basis of pair formation. Old females are not particularly selected for pairing.

However, aromatase, the key enzyme for estrogen synthesis, although it is more abundant in males, is expressed and active in the brain of females where it is regulated by similar mechanisms as in males. Early work had shown that estrogens produced in the ventromedial hypothalamus are involved in the regulation of female sexual behavior in musk shrews. However, the question of the role of central aromatase in general had not received much attention until recently. Here, I will review the emerging concept that central aromatization plays a role in the regulation of physiological and behavioral endpoints in females. The data support the notion that in females, brain aromatase is not simply a non-functional evolutionary vestige, and provide support for the importance of locally produced estrogens for brain function in females.

Most studies have found weak continuous increases of fitness with increasing heterozygosity, while negative HFCs have rarely been reported. Negative HFCs are expected in cases of outbreeding depression, but outbreeding is rare in natural populations. Negative HFCs may also arise through viability selection acting on low heterozygosity individuals at an early stage producing a skew in the heterozygosity distribution. We tested this idea using survival and clutch parameters (egg mass, egg volume, chick mass, clutch size) in female Black Grouse Lyrurus tetrix and carried out simulations to determine how survival selection may impact the HFCs measured using clutch parameters. We show that survival is positively related to both individual heterozygosity and female body mass. There was a positive effect of body mass on all clutch parameters, but the selective mortality of females with both low heterozygosity and low body mass led to overrepresentation of high heterozygosity-low body mass females and hence a negative relationship between egg volume and heterozygosity. Using simulated data, we show that survival selection acting on both low body mass and low heterozygosity leads to a skew in the quality of breeding females, resulting in negative HFCs with egg volume. Our results indicate that survival selection can strongly influence the strength and direction of any HFCs that occur later in life and that only an integration of all aspects of individual reproductive investment and reproductive success can enable us to fully understand how heterozygosity can shape individual fitness.";"Inbreeding; Outbreeding; Neutral loci; Selective mortality; Genetic diversity";2018;"JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The environmental variables of spring and winter sites were collected in three layers in a 100 m radius from the place of recording of the Hazel Grouse: canopy, understory and undergrowth. According to our study, the proportion of deciduous trees was greater in spring territories in comparison to winter territories in all studied layers. Conversely, greater species richness in the undergrowth and understory in spring sites of Hazel Grouse was found in comparison to winter sites. Moreover, a greater proportion of birch, poplar, willow, wild cherry and bird cherry were found in the spring sites of Hazel Grouse in comparison to winter sites. Generalized Linear Model models showed that the occurrence of overgrown clearings, clearfellings with deadwood and higher richness of grass and herbs and their cover in the forest were important habitat factors for Hazel Grouse in both spring and winter sites. Sites of Hazel Grouse were strongly affected by the proportions of beech, sycamore, fir, spruce and larch in the canopy layer in both seasons. Moreover, a greater proportion of tree species producing nuts, drupes or winged seeds was important in both spring and winter sites. Bush cover was important for winter sites of the Hazel Grouse.

For ground-nesting birds, vegetation surrounding the nest may play an important role in mediating nest success by providing concealment from predators. Height of grasses surrounding the nest is thought to be a driver of nest survival in greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse), a species that has experienced widespread population declines throughout their range. However, a growing body of the literature has found that widely used field methods can produce misleading inference on the relationship between grass height and nest success. Specifically, it has been demonstrated that measuring concealment following nest fate (failure or hatch) introduces a temporal bias whereby successful nests are measured later in the season, on average, than failed nests. This sampling bias can produce inference suggesting a positive effect of grass height on nest survival, though the relationship arises due to the confounding effect of plant phenology, not an effect on predation risk. To test the generality of this finding for sage-grouse, we reanalyzed existing datasets comprising >800 sage-grouse nests from three independent studies across the range where there was a positive relationship found between grass height and nest survival, including two using methods now known to be biased. Correcting for phenology produced equivocal relationships between grass height and sage-grouse nest survival. Viewed in total, evidence for a ubiquitous biological effect of grass height on sage-grouse nest success across time and space is lacking. In light of these findings, a reevaluation of land management guidelines emphasizing specific grass height targets to promote nest success may be merited.";"Centrocercus urophasianus; concealment; greater sage-grouse; nest survival; phenology";2018;"ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION";"Ecology; Evolutionary Biology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Here, we synthesize the literature reporting effects of brush management on wildlife and make recommendations for applying brush management to accomplish wildlife conservation objectives. Key observations arising from our synthesis are that habitat-related terminology is often misused in brush management literature. Recommending brush management as a ""wildlife habitat improvement"" tool is a non sequitur because habitat is species specific and brush management has different consequences for different species of wildlife and plants. Communication between resource managers and stakeholders can be improved by making it clear that habitat is species specific and then identifying what constitutes a benefit of brush management. Changes in resources resulting from brush management may not benefit targeted wildlife species unless these changes overcome some limiting factor or factors. Wildlife responses to brush management treatments are too complex to make broad generalizations because they are mediated by environmental factors and depend on the plant community, size and configuration of the area manipulated, type of treatment applied, and time since application. Prescriptions aimed at improving habitat for wildlife generalists may have relatively modest positive effects on that group but have potentially detrimental effects on specialists. Given this potential trade-off, an idea to consider is that it may be best to err on the side of using brush management as a tool to manage habitat for specialists. Brush management plans and recommendations should take into account trade-offs such as benefiting grassland wildlife at the expense of woodland species. Taking a broader ""systems"" perspective that balances needs of wildlife in conjunction with other ecosystem services affected by woody plant encroachment and brush management should be a goal of natural resource managers.

To focus management on resistance and resilience of Wyoming big sagebrush communities with varying species composition, we studied 51 paired sites with burned and unburned areas. We quantified soil surface and foliar cover in 12 cover groups. Comparisons identified vegetation or soil surface factors that significantly (p <= 0.05) correlated (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient = rho) to burned area community composition. Cheatgrass cover in burned areas was greater where unburned areas had more cheatgrass cover (rho = 0.75), litter cover (rho = 0.31), and sagebrush plant canopy volume (rho = 0.40), and less bare soil (rho= -0.39) and cryptogamcover (rho= -0.32). Cheatgrass cover in burned areas was not significantly correlated with unburned area perennial grass or forb cover. Burned area perennial grass cover appeared to be related to more perennial grass (rho = 0.77) and native forb cover (rho = 0.30), but less cheatgrass cover (rho = -0.39) in unburned areas. Burned area native herbaceous dominance (native minus exotic herbaceous foliar cover) correlated with less cheatgrass cover (rho = -0.65) and sagebrush canopy volume (rho = -0.34) in unburned areas and with more perennial grass (rho = 0.30) and sagebrush relative cover (rho = 0.39) in adjacent unburned areas. Postfire site dominance could be of either native or exotic plants where cheatgrass cover on adjacent unburned sites was < about 15%. Native species however, never dominated or increased in dominance where cheatgrass was above 15%. Results suggest that cheatgrass cover before a fire played a strong role in determining postfire plant communities; this suggests management should focus on prefire and postfire management of cheatgrass and litter. Perhaps prescriptions and priorities should be more nuanced on the basis of driving variables of postfire response hypothesized to be cheatgrass, perennial grass, and shrub abundance.

Before incubation at embryonic day 0, C-14 3,3',4, 4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (C-14 PCB 77) was injected into Japanese quail eggs either onto the air cell or into the albumen. All egg components were collected on embryonic day 1, 5, or 10, and concentrations of C-14 PCB 77 were measured in various egg components (shell, membrane, yolk, albumen, and embryo). The results showed measurable C-14 PCB 77 in all egg components, with changing concentrations in each egg component over the course of embryonic development. Specifically, concentrations in the shell content decreased between embryonic days 1 and 10, increased in albumen from embryonic days 1 to 5 and then decreased at embryonic day 10, and increased in both yolk and embryo from embryonic days 1 to 10. Vehicle and injection site both influenced C-14 PCB 77 allantoic fluid concentrations, with little effect on other egg components except for the inner shell membrane. The fatty acid vehicle injected into the albumen yielded the highest C-14 PCB 77 recovery. These findings demonstrate dynamic movement of toxicants throughout the egg components during avian embryonic development and a steady increase of relatively low levels of C-14 PCB 77 in the embryo compared with the yolk, albumen, and shell, suggesting that embryonic uptake (i.e., exposure) mirrors utilization of egg components for nutrition and growth during development.

Cestodiasis prevalence was 90%, and there was no difference in prevalence between birds harvested in Cornwall, Wessex, East Anglia and Scotland. High prevalence levels were explained by the fact that earthworms (Lumbricidae) are intermediate hosts for some cestode species and also the most important dietary component of woodcock. The distribution of cestodiasis in woodcock was aggregated, such that when using the total length of cestodes per sample to measure abundance, 65% of the birds had less than 80 cm. Cestodiasis abundance varied between sexes across regions but the intensity was not affected by region, sex, age or their interactions. The intensity of cestodiasis was positively correlated with fresh weight and pectoral mass, while no significant correlation was found with the abdominal fat pad. Our results suggest that, despite high prevalence levels and intensity of cestodiasis in woodcock, host body condition is not significantly affected and hence it is unlikely that cestodiasis has a major effect on woodcock population dynamics.";NA;2018;"JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY";"Parasitology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Decades of genetic selection have resulted in significant dissimilarities in metabolism and growth between breeds, in particular fast-growing broilers and highly productive layers. A chicken develops the capacity to elevate metabolism in response to decreases in ambient temperature upon hatching, including well-developed methods of regulating thermogenesis. However, a differential timing between incipient endothermic capacities of broiler and layer strains exists. Although both broiler and layer chicks show the hallmark rapid attainment of endothermic capacity of precocial birds, endothermic capacity of broilers matures faster than that of layers. Here we characterized changes in morphology and mitochondria physiology during the developmental transition as the animals become endothermic. Changes in body mass occurred at a faster rate in broilers, with hatching embryos showing significant increases over embryonic body mass, while layers did not exhibit significant differences in mass until after hatch. Heart and liver both exhibited rapid growth upon hatching that occurred with little change in body mass in both breeds. Skeletal and cardiac mitochondrial respiration capacity in broilers increased from the embryonic stage through hatching. Oxidative phosphorylation was more tightly coupled to ATP production in broilers than layer muscles during external pipping. By selecting for faster growth and higher meat yield, the physiological transition from ectothermy to endothermy was also affected: differences in whole-animal, tissue, and organelle responses are evident in these two divergent breeds of chicken.";"Mitochondria; Development; Ventricle; Endotherm; Cardiomyocyte; Skeletal muscle";2018;"COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY";"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Physiology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Aims: To assess the level of monitoring of status/trends of raptors across Europe, to produce a webbased inventory of activities. Methods: A questionnaire promoted by voluntary national coordinators assessed monitoring coverage, focusing on breeding populations. Results: One thousand one hundred and ninety-six species schemes (236 monitoring programmes; 90% active in 2012) were reported from 37 countries. Sixty per cent of schemes were of over 10 years duration and nine countries ran schemes of over 40 years duration. Nineteen species had at least one scheme in 10 or more countries, and 15 species had schemes that ran for over 10 years. Thirteen species had breeding monitoring schemes in over 50% of countries where they breed, including widespread species (e.g. Peregrine Falcon Falco peregrinus) and localized species (e.g. Rough-legged Buzzard Buteo lagopus). Lanner Falcon Falco biarmicus, Levant Sparrowhawk Accipiter brevipes and Booted Eagle Hieraaetus pennatus had the least representative coverage, and four rare species had no coverage. Coverage was more representative in north and west Europe than further south and east. Coverage was more representative for widespread species and those with more favourable conservation status.

Widespread, long-term population declines in greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) have elicited concern about potential negative effects of livestock management practices on sage-grouse populations. We evaluated how recently implemented rotational grazing systems affected sage-grouse nesting habitat quality as part of a large-scale, replicated, natural experiment in central Montana, USA. We used Bayesian methods to assess support for effects of rotational grazing management and rest from grazing on daily survival rates of nearly 500 sage-grouse nests monitored over 6 years, and mixed effects models to test for effects of rotational grazing and rest on vegetation structure. Though nests on rotationally grazed ranches displayed a trend toward greater daily survival rates, the evidence for an effect was weak. There was no evidence that rest from grazing (12 months) increased daily survival rates. Furthermore, rotational grazing systems and rest had negligible effects on herbaceous vegetation height and cover relative to other grazing strategies used in the study area. Results do not support the hypothesis that rotational grazing systems or rest from grazing increase nest success in the northern Great Plains. Estimated nest success, however, was comparable to range-wide averages, suggesting concealing cover for nests is unlikely to be limiting growth of this population regardless of grazing strategy. In light of these results and recent research questioning reported relationships between grass height and nest survival, maximization of hiding cover may be overemphasized in grazing management guidelines and policies. Rather, our findings suggest a variety of locally appropriate grazing strategies focused on fundamental range health principles may provide adequate habitat quality for nesting sage-grouse.

For prairie-obligate species, space use and demography in extant grasslands are influenced by habitat conditions caused by rangeland management practices associated with livestock production. Greater prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus cupido) are an indicator species for native tallgrass prairie ecosystems, but populations have declined in the Flint Hills ecoregion of eastern Kansas, USA because of intensification of rangeland management practices, including annual prescribed fire and high stocking densities. Patch-burn grazing is a rotational system that provides heterogeneous habitats and can improve productivity of grassland birds, but the effects of grazing systems on habitat use or survival of greater prairie-chickens are unknown. We used 3 types of survival analyses to investigate impacts of rangeland management on female greater prairie-chickens in the central Flint Hills during 2011-2013: Kaplan-Meier models and Cox proportional hazards to examine factors affecting annual survival rates, hazard functions to assess seasonal patterns of mortality, and Andersen-Gill models to explore the links between habitat selection and cause-specific mortality risk. Females captured at properties managed with patch-burn grazing had annual survival rates (0.610.07SE) that were 35% higher than females on properties managed with annual burning and intensive early cattle stocking (0.45 +/- 0.06). Moreover, females that selected habitats associated with intensive management had increased mortality risk and were particularly vulnerable to avian predators, whereas females that selected habitats created by patch-burn grazing experienced lower overall mortality risk but were more vulnerable to mammalian predators. Overall mortality risk was significantly reduced under patch-burn grazing management, and widespread implementation of annual spring burning and intensive early stocking is likely depressing survival of greater prairie-chickens in the Flint Hills ecoregion.

We determined empirical support for different hypothesized causes of declines: habitat loss, forest maturation, and the introduction of West Nile virus (WNV) in the early 2000s. We examined how these factors relate to declines observed in 2 data sets: changes between 2 Breeding Bird Atlas (BBA) surveys in Pennsylvania conducted in the 1980s and 2000s and a 48-year time series of flush rate data. Initial occupancy of BBA blocks was positively related to the amount of available forested habitat, and persistence and colonization probabilities were negatively related to WNV intensity and positively related to available forest and to increasing trends in early successional habitat. Flush rates dropped in most regions after the arrival of WNV, but trend estimates were imprecisely estimated, and there was considerable uncertainty about whether or how the slope of annual trends in flush rates changed. Our results provide support for the importance of forest and early successional forest, but taken together with other supporting evidence for the presence of WNV in wild ruffed grouse populations and mortality in ruffed grouse chicks caused by WNV infection, our results also suggest that ruffed grouse populations might have been affected by mortality from WNV. In the face of WNV, managing habitat may be insufficient to sustain ruffed grouse populations. (c) 2017 The Wildlife Society. Based on our results and corroborating evidence, we conclude that West Nile virus likely contributed to ruffed grouse population declines in Pennsylvania, notwithstanding the well-known and equally negative effects of habitat loss and forest maturation.

This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Neottia cordata (L.) Rich. (Lesser Twayblade; Listera cordata (L.) R. Br.) that are relevant to an understanding of its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, reproductive characteristics, herbivores, history and conservation. 2. Neottia cordata is an inconspicuous orchid, confined to humid heathlands and woodlands rich in bryophytes in the British Isles. 3. Neottia cordata is a polycarpic, perennial herb with populations maintained predominantly by vegetative reproduction from root suckers. The main perennating organ is a short rhizome that produces two new internodes each year. The long adventitious roots are mainly colonized not only by mycorrhizal basidiomycetes from the Sebacinales (clade B, Serendipitaceae) but also by several other fungal groups. 4. The species flowers from mid-April to August depending on latitude and altitude. The flowers possess a sensitive rostellum that releases a viscid fluid when touched, ensuring that the pollinia are glued to the pollinator. The flowers produce nectar and are pollinated mainly by fungus gnats (Mycetophilidae and Sciaridae). Between 60% and 80% of open flowers set fruits. 5. Neottia cordata is classified as Least Concern in Great Britain. It is still locally abundant in north and west Scotland but has declined elsewhere, especially at lower altitudes, because of burning on grouse moors, drainage of swamps and cutting of wet forests. It is likely to have been under-recorded throughout its range, particularly in earlier surveys, due to its inconspicuousness.";"communities; conservation; geographical and altitudinal distribution; germination; herbivory; mycorrhiza; reproductive biology; rostellum";2018;"JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY";"Plant Sciences; Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

However, non-raptor birds are also poisoned (rodenticide exposure resulting in adverse effects including mortality) by rodenticides through consumption of the rodenticide bait and contaminated prey. A literature search for rodenticide incidents (evidence of exposure to a rodenticide, adverse effects, or exposure to placebo baits) involving non-raptor birds returned 641 records spanning the years 1931 to 2016. The incidents included 17 orders, 58 families, and 190 non-raptor bird species. Nineteen anticoagulant and non-anticoagulant rodenticide active ingredients were associated with the incidents. The number of incidents and species detected were compared by surveillance method. An incident was considered to have been reported through passive surveillance if it was voluntarily reported to the authorities whereas the report of an incident found through fieldwork that was conducted with the objective of documenting adverse effects on birds was determined to be from active surveillance. More incidents were reported from passive surveillance than with active surveillance but a significantly greater number of species were detected in proportion to the number of incidents found through active surveillance than with passive surveillance (z = 7.61, p < 0.01). Results suggest that reliance on only one surveillance method can underestimate the number of incidents that have occurred and the number of species that are affected. Although rodenticides are used worldwide, incident records were found from only 15 countries. Therefore, awareness of the breadth of species diversity of non-raptor bird poisonings from rodenticides may increase incident reportings and can strengthen the predictions of harm characterized by risk assessments.

For oviduct length and weight, which exhibited moderate heritability estimates of 0.35 and 0.39, respectively, chromosome 1 (GGA1) explained 9.45% of the genetic variance, while GGA4 to GGA8 and GGA11 explained over 1% of the variance. Independent univariate genome-wide screens for oviduct length and weight detected 69 significant SNPs on GGA1 and 49 suggestive SNPs on GGA1, GGA4, and GGA8.

We evaluated behavioral and temporal factors affecting Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) breeding season individual availability for detection during three common survey times (3 min, 5 min, 10 min). We conducted 10-minute surveys associated with radio-collared male Northern Bobwhites on Peabody Wildlife Management Area, Kentucky, from 2010 +/- 2011. We homed to within 50 m of radio-collared males and recorded number of distinct Northern Bobwhite whistles (singing rate) per 1-minute interval, number of other males calling during the survey, minutes-since-sunrise, and day-of-season. We also recorded the number of minutes during a 10-minute survey that radio-collared male Northern Bobwhites called. We used logistic regression to estimate availability of radio-collared individuals for 3-minute, 5-minute, and 10-minute surveys. We also modeled number of minutes during 10-minute surveys that radio-collared Northern Bobwhites called, and we modeled singing rate. Individual availability for detection of radio-collared individuals during a 10-minute survey increased by 100% when at least 1 other Northern Bobwhite called during a survey (6.5% to 13.1%) and by 626% when 6 other Northern Bobwhites were calling (6.5% to 47.6%). Individual availability was 30% greater for 10-minute surveys than 5-minute surveys or 55% greater for 10-minute surveys than 3-minute surveys. Northern Bobwhite called most (2.8 +/- 0.66 minutes/10-min survey) and at a greater rate (11.8 +/- 1.3 calls/10-min period) when at least 5 other Northern Bobwhites called.

Although our understanding of hunger in rodents is advanced, an equivalent understanding in birds is lacking. In particular, the relationship between peripheral energy indices and hypothalamic 'hunger' peptides, agouti-related protein (AgRP), proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) is poorly understood. Here, we compare AgRP, POMC and NPY RNA levels in the hypothalamus of Red Junglefowl chicks raised under ad libitum, chronic restriction and intermittent feeding regimens. Hypothalamic gene expression differed between chronically and intermittently restricted birds, confirming that different restriction regimens elicit different patterns of hunger. By assessing the relationship between hypothalamic gene expression and carcass traits, we show for the first time in birds that AgRP and POMC are responsive to fat-related measures and therefore represent long-term energy status. Chronically restricted birds, having lower indices of fat, show elevated hunger according to AgRP and POMC. NPY was elevated in intermittently fasted birds during fasting, suggesting a role as a short-term index of hunger.

Conversely, interactions in large groups are modulated by badges of status. Previous studies suggested that birds differing in phenotypic appearance (PA) became targets for aggression, possibly mistaking altered PA for badges of status. We evaluated the impact of altering PA on 0, 30, 50, 70 or 100% of the birds' house at three experimental group sizes (GS). Tested GS were 10, 20 or 40 (8 birds/m(2), 3 pens/GSxPA, 45 total). Thus, for each GS we had groups initially homogenous (100U, U = Unmarked; 100M, M = Marked), or heterogeneous M and U phenotypes coexisting in different proportions: 30M/70U, 50M/50U, and 70M/30U, remaining unchanged until 33 weeks of age. Then, homogeneous groups (100U and 100M) were sequentially altered by marking or unmarking 30, 50 and 70% of birds at 34, 38 and 44 weeks, respectively. Aggressive interactions were observed before applying changes at 27-28 weeks (T0), and after each sequential PA change on week 35-36 (T1), 39-40 (T2) and 45-46 (T3). Frequency of aggressive interactions in altered groups at T1, T2, and T3 were compared with non-altered heterogeneous controls. Results indicate no differences across initial PA and GS treatments (T0; P>0.05). However, aggression escalation was observed at T1 immediately after the first PA manipulation (Tukey P<0.05 altered vs controls). Aggression in altered groups remained high at T2 when compared to controls (Tukey, P<0.05), although by T3 interactions declined to almost initial levels (Tukey, P>0.05 altered vs controls). Aggressive interactions at T1 and T2 were predominantly directed from un-altered towards recently altered birds, irrespectively of their initial phenotype and of the GS.

Its breeding biology is poorly known. Methods: This study was conducted in three sites in the major tropical primary rainforest in Hainan. Nests of the Hainan Partridge were found by monitoring radio-tracked individuals. Video recorders were set up to monitor reproductive behaviour of Hainan Partridge when nests were found. Results: Here for the first time we report the breeding biology of Hainan Partridge by providing information on its nest site, nest, eggs, and reproductive behaviour. We found that Hainan Partridges laid immaculate white eggs in ground nests which were totally covered by dry leaves and small branches forming arches that provided optimal concealment. A novel and regular behaviour was found in Hainan Partridges since they grasped leaves and small branches and then threw them on or around their nests to provide cover during incubation and after hatching of chicks. Conclusions: Recruitment behaviour in Hainan Partridges benefit from supplementation of nest arch material to nests, cover the nest entrance and thus maintain or increase nest concealment. However, it may also contribute to concealment of the track which could expose their activities and clues for predators. Our finding implies that the Hainan Partridge has evolved such a novel reproductive behaviour under the strong selection of predation pressure.

This pattern favors heat dissipation by evaporative water loss (EWL) through the respiratory tract. We asked to what extent this response was apparent at the earliest stages of development, when pulmonary ventilation initiates. Measurements of pulmonary ventilation (V. E; barometric technique), VO2 (open-flow methodology) and EWL (water scrubbers) were performed on chicken embryos at the earliest appearance of pulmonary ventilation, during the internal pipping stage. Data were collected, first, at the normal incubation temperature (37.5 degrees C); then, ambient and egg temperatures were increased to approximately 44 degrees C over a 2 h period. Other embryos of the same developmental stage (controls) were maintained in normothermia for the whole duration of the experiment. During heat exposure, the embryo's VO2 and carbon dioxide production increased little. In contrast, V. E more than doubled (similar to 128% increase), entirely because of the large rise in breathing frequency (similar to 132% increase), with no change in tidal volume. EWLdid not change significantly, probably because, within the egg, the thermal and water vapor gradients are almost nonexistent. We conclude that chicken embryos respond to a major heat load with tachypnea, like many adult mammals and birds do. Its appearance so early in development, although ineffective for heat loss, signifies that thermal tachypnea represents an important breathing response necessary to be functional from hatching.";"Heat stress; Breathing pattern; O-2 consumption; CO2 production; Evaporative water loss; Breathing frequency";2017;"JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY";"Biology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The Chinese Grouse (Tetrastes sewerzowi) is a rare and endemic species with relatively small distribution range and decreasing population trend. It is important to elucidate breeding territory habitat requirements of the Chinese Grouse for habitat management and conservation actions. Methods: Using radio-telemetry and field observations, we determined the core areas of 65 breeding territories of males. Two to three samples were selected in each core breeding territory as used sites and compared with nearby sites with no grouse occurrence using logistic regression. Results: Our model showed a high accuracy in prediction of core breeding territory used by males, which preferred stands with more small deciduous trees (0.5 m <= height < 5 m), more small willow trees (Salix spp., 0.5 m <= height < 5 m), greater willow cover, and greater herb cover. The number of small willow trees had the greatest influence on males' core breeding territory selection. Dense shrubs were also chosen compared with unused sites. Tall conifer trees was an important determinant in the distribution of Chinese Grouse at the landscape scale, and was relatively important in the univariate model, but not included in our final multivariable model. Conclusions: Male Chinese Grouse established territories at sites with abundant food resources. At the landscape scale, the Chinese Grouse occurred in alpine conifer forest. At the territory scale, small willow trees had the most important effect on males' core breeding territory selection. We suggest that the forest gaps in dense conifer forest are important for improving the occurrence of willows and facilitating breeding territory establishment for the Chinese Grouse.";"Salix spp.; Chinese Grouse; Territory; Core area; Conifer forest; Logistic regression";2017;"AVIAN RESEARCH";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The extent to which vertebrate species may serve as suitable umbrellas for invertebrate species, however, has rarely been explored. Sage-grouse (Centrocercus spp.) have high conservation priority throughout much of the rangelands of western North America and are considered an umbrella species through which the conservation of entire rangeland ecosystems can be accomplished. Harvester ants are ecosystem engineers and play important roles in the maintenance and function of rangeland ecosystems. We compared indices of the abundance of western harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex occidentalis) and Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) at 72 sites in central Wyoming, USA, in 2012. The abundance of harvester ant mounds was best predicted by a regression model that included a combination of local habitat characteristics and the abundance of sage-grouse. When controlling for habitat-related factors, areas with higher abundances of sage-grouse pellets (an index of sage-grouse abundance and/or habitat use) had higher abundances of ant mounds than areas with lower abundances of sage-grouse pellets. The causal mechanism underlying this positive relationship between sage-grouse and ant mound abundance at the fine scale could be indirect (e.g., both species prefer similar environmental conditions) or direct (e.g., sage-grouse prefer areas with a high abundance of ant mounds because ants are an important prey item during certain life stages). We observed no relationship between a broad-scale index of breeding sage-grouse density and the abundance of ant mounds. We suspect that consideration of the nonbreeding habitat of sage-grouse and finer-scale measures of sagegrouse abundance are critical to the utility of sage-grouse as an umbrella species for the conservation of harvester ants and their important role in rangeland ecosystems.";NA;2017;"WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST";"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We collected freshly laid Grey Partridge Perdixperdix eggs to determine the effects of laying gaps on egg characteristics. Egg shape, as well as egg components (beta-carotene, avidin and lysozyme concentrations) did not vary in relation to skipped days. Eggs were slightly heavier when one or two days were skipped (0.72% and 0.45%, respectively). However, when examining the hatching rate, we found a significant decrease in relation to skipped days, hence eggs following laying gaps showed a lower hatching rate than other eggs.

This species is considered endangered because of their small populations, the loss and fragmentation of habitat, illegal trade, and overexploitation by subsistence hunters. We update information about the species' diet and foraging behavior by integrating the results generated during two and a half decades of research on the Horned Guan's ecology at the El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve, in Chiapas, Mexico, with additional published information compiled from other areas. Based on nearly 450 hrs of direct observations of free-ranging guans and 530 discrete feeding events, we found that during the breeding season Horned Guans feed primarily on fruits from six species of plants and leaves from one species. Horned Guans were not observed eating animal matter, corroborating its specialized frugivore-folivore habits. Our study increases the known plant taxa found in the Horned Guan's diet in El Triunfo from 40 to 63 (Supplemental Material), and globally to 101 species (Supplemental Material). For 48 taxa in El Triunfo, only fruits were consumed, while for eleven taxa consumption was restricted to leaves, and to flowers for one species; for four taxa both fruits and leaves were consumed. We found significant differences between males and females in the location of foraging on trees and diet composition. Young birds are fed fruits of Citharexylum mocinnii and leaves of Solanum appendiculatum by their mothers, both of which are rare in the diet of adult males.

Habitat loss can affect landscape carrying capacity, and may exacerbate otherwise normal fluctuations in populations during periods of drought, anomalous weather, or other stochastic events. Previous work provided a unified long-term (1965-2012) assessment of lesser prairie-chicken population dynamics and projections of persistence in the Southern Great Plains. Despite the final year of data collection coinciding with a record-setting drought, lesser prairie-chicken populations exhibited reasonable probabilities of persistence for 3 of the 4 ecoregions in which they occur. Our objective was to validate previous population forecasts with 4 years of additional data (post-drought). We assessed long-term (1964-2016) changes in lesser prairie-chicken populations, using reconstructed population abundances from lek count and aerial survey data, and projected likely future probabilities of persistence. Based on our validations, model forecasts appear to provide a reasonable ability to project population abundance in the near term (approximate to 5 yr). Population abundances have largely edged upward since the extreme drought conditions of 2011-2012. Additionally, near-term extirpation risks have been reduced measurably for 3 of the 4 ecoregions and the range-wide population as a result of increased annual growth rates. Meta-population analysis indicated that each ecoregion had similar likelihoods of persistence as estimated independently for each single population, (i.e., without gene flow), but the longest term probability of extinction for the range-wide meta-population (i.e., with gene flow) was reduced by half as compared to the range-wide population modeled with disconnected subpopulations (i.e., ecoregions). Regardless, our results continue to support the importance of maintaining connectivity between ecoregions and core areas therein.

Satellite tracking of nesting Snowy Owls in Alaska and eastern Canada has allowed researchers to document the widely nomadic movements of these owls between summer and winter ranges. This study expands that knowledge for Snowy Owls in the western Canadian Arctic. Based on previous studies, we predicted that owls: (1) would not have strong fidelity to specific winter or summer ranges; (2) would travel widely in search of breeding and nonbreeding areas at which they would settle for considerable time (months); (3) would choose areas to settle based on prey concentration; and (4) would use a mix of overwintering strategies, with some staying in Arctic and boreal regions, and some migrating south. Movement patterns of four female owls captured at nesting sites on Herschel Island, Yukon Territory, Canada, supported the first two predictions. The third prediction was partly supported: some sites of summer settlement wore located where prey was relatively abundant, whereas other selected sites did not appear to have enough prey for successful nesting. The latter sites may have been the best available in those areas, however. Sites of winter settlement generally overlapped regions with high abundance of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) or ptarmigan (Lagopus spp.), and were located in relatively open alpine, subalpine, or wetland environments,where prey were likely most accessible. Contrary to our last prediction, all four study owls settled in boreal Alaska and the northern Yukon Territory. This pattern contrasts with observations that eastern North American Snowy Owls rarely wintered in the boreal biome. This study highlights the need to better understand the habitat choices and food habits of wintering Snowy Owls in the northern boreal mountains.";"Snowy Owl; Bubo scandiacus; migration; movements; North America; seasonal habitat; wintering; YukonTerritory";2017;"JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We examined the spatial and temporal patterns of release and shooting between 1960 and 2014 using data from a self-selected sample of 1195 sites. We examined changes in the efficiency of release, the contribution of birds that were not released that year to the numbers shot, and the form of these relationships through time. An annual estimate of the efficiency by which releasing increased the numbers shot was 50% over the period 1960-1990 declining rapidly to 35% by 2005 and reducing more slowly thereafter. There was no obvious regional pattern to this relationship. It has been hypothesised that the efficiency of releasing is lower on sites that release higher densities of pheasants; this study does not support this hypothesis. Annual variation in the density of birds shot in the absence of releasing (1960-1990) was closely correlated with a measure of annual gamebird chick survival. After this date, the relationship was no longer significant, consistent with a decline in wild pheasant stocks and coinciding with the declines in other farmland birds. We highlight increased fox abundance, genetic and behavioural changes arising from the rearing process, and increased shooting in late winter as possible causes for the observed decline in releasing efficiency. We consider the general increase in rearing, habitat changes, increased disease or losses to protected predators as unlikely to have been important causes of the changes in releasing efficiency.

This study aimed to determine the genetic effects of such large-scale releases of a native species, specifically if wild and released farmed mallards differ genetically among subpopulations in Europe, if there are signs of admixture between the two groups, if the genetic structure of the wild mallard population has changed since large-scale releases began in the 1970s, and if the current data matches global patterns across the Northern hemisphere. We used Bayesian clustering (STRUCTURE software) and Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC) to analyze the genetic structure of historical and present-day wild (n = 171 and n = 209, respectively) as well as farmed (n = 211) mallards from six European countries as inferred by 360 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Both methods showed a clear genetic differentiation between wild and farmed mallards. Admixed individuals were found in the present-day wild population, implicating introgression of farmed genotypes into wild mallards despite low survival among released farmed mallards. Such cryptic introgression would alter the genetic composition of wild populations and may have unknown long-term consequences for conservation.";"Cryptic introgression; Hand-reared; Hybridization; Restocking; SNP; Wildlife management";2017;"EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Bird conservation groups and organizations concerned with the health and immunological status of avian populations are interested in haemosporidian parasites that affect reproduction and population growth. Haemosporidian infection data are not yet always available for some avian species in specific regions. These data provide the starting points for researchers to evaluate geographical and temporal changes in the patterns of infection and prevalence across populations. We examined haemoparasite infections in four game bird species commonly hunted in Illinois. We calculated prevalence, mean intensity, median intensity, and mean abundance of haemosporidians, and evaluated the relation of these infection measures associated with age and sex of the avian hosts. Game species sampled (N = 237) included migrants such as mourning doves Zenaida macroura, wood ducks Aix sponsa, and Canada geese Branta canadensis, as well as resident birds such as wild turkeys Meleagris gallopavo. We identified only Haemoproteus, Plasmodium, and Leucocytozoon species. Haemoproteus was the most prevalent haemosporidian (46/237), followed by Plasmodium (11/237). Furthermore, Haemoproteus was the most persistent haemosporidian, as it was the only parasite genera that we found in all four avian species. We found coinfections in 55% of turkeys, but found no significant correlations between the genera of haemosporidinan coinfections and a host species. Moreover, no significant differences in the proportion of infected individuals (prevalence) and haemosporidian quantities (levels of intensity and abundance) were related to biotic factors such as age and sex of the host. However, parasite aggregation (distribution of parasites among hosts) was affected by age, as adult turkeys and juvenile doves showed the highest aggregation index (Poulin's index of discrepancy) for Haemoproteus spp. This study reveals patterns of infection and parasite aggregations that vary widely among different game bird species and provides baseline data on avian haemosporidians that, to the best of our knowledge, is not currently available in the state of Illinois for these avian species.

The spatial scales of habitat relationships are often unknown, and are expected to follow a multi-scale hierarchy. Typical frequentist or information theoretic approaches often suffer under collinearity in multi-scale studies, fail to converge when models are complex or represent an intractable computational burden when candidate model sets are large. Our objective was to implement an automated, Bayesian method for inference on the spatial scales of habitat variables that best predict animal abundance. We introduce Bayesian latent indicator scale selection (BLISS), a Bayesian method to select spatial scales of predictors using latent scale indicator variables that are estimated with reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. BLISS does not suffer from collinearity, and substantially reduces computation time of studies. We present a simulation study to validate our method and apply our method to a case-study of land cover predictors for ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) abundance in Nebraska, USA. Our method returns accurate descriptions of the explanatory power of multiple spatial scales, and unbiased and precise parameter estimates under commonly encountered data limitations including spatial scale autocorrelation, effect size, and sample size. BLISS outperforms commonly used model selection methods including stepwise and AIC, and reduces runtime by 90%. Given the pervasiveness of scale-dependency in ecology, and the implications of mismatches between the scales of analyses and ecological processes, identifying the spatial scales over which species are integrating habitat information is an important step in understanding species-habitat relationships. BLISS is a widely applicable method for identifying important spatial scales, propagating scale uncertainty, and testing hypotheses of scaling relationships.";"Abundance; Bayesian model selection; Habitat selection; Model uncertainty; Spatial scale";2017;"LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY";"Ecology; Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The area shelters a high diversity of habitats, representing the main formations found in this sub-region: grasslands, savannah, forested savannah, riparian forests, bays and salines, and Negro river itself. This habitat variability determines the structure and dynamics of the bird community, because most species are closely related to specific habitats. For this, we studied the abundance of bird species from 2001 to 2004 in a Pantanal area of Fazenda Rio Negro, Aquidauana, Brazil. The abundance was compared among those four consecutive years, seasons (dry and wet), time of the day (morning and afternoon), and also between seven different habitats, in order to determine the variation in distribution patterns and habitats used by birds. For this, we used the linear transect method in each of the seven habitats, and recorded bird abundances to obtain richness. The richness registered in the mosaic of habitats was of 201 species for the savannah, 87 in forested savannah, 116 in the riparian forest, 75 in grasslands, 120 in bays, 92 in the salines and 64 in the Negro river, accounting for 348 species in the Pantanal of Rio Negro. Overall, 98 species of migratory birds were registered. The results highlighted some important issues regarding the total abundance of birds in Nhecolandia: Psittacidae was the most abundant family in the region, with prominence in all environments. Recurvirostridae, a monospecific family, showed expressive abundance due to the dominance of Himantopus mexicanus in the salinas, followed by Ardeidae, Anatidae and Cracidae. Other families with high abundance were Tyrannidae, Columbidae, Thraupidae and Emberizidae, all in predominantly terrestrial environments. Moreover: a) The highest number of specimens was recorded in the morning period and in the dry season, regardless of the habitat; b) there were no differences in abundance in the same habitat along the years, but the abundance was different among habitats. In general, the results indicated that there is a relatively stable bird population in each habitat along the annual cycle, but there were differences in abundance among habitats. Thus, additional studies on food availability in dry and wet seasons should be better explored in the future, either in this region or in other Pantanal regions. This fact could better explain the seasonal dynamics of the richness and abundance of birds in the Pantanal area in general.";"pantanal; bird community; mosaic of habitats; Mato Grosso do Sul";2017;"REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL";"Biology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Results showed the concentrations of Cu in the Cu group were increased by 57.8%, 27.57% and 57.2% at 30, 60 and 90 days, respectively.

Moreover, Cu exposure activated the NF-KB-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokines, decreased the mRNA levels of opal, mfnl, mfn2, Bcl-2, increased the mRNA levels of drpl, Bax, caspase-3, caspase-9, P53, while not altered Fas and caspase-8 compared with the control group. Similarly, western blot results showed the same trend of mRNA. Correlation analysis indicated that mitochondrial fission and intrinsic apoptosis might function synergistic. Moreover, mitochondrial network seem to function as cytosolic sensors for the induction of NF-KB mediated inflammatory responses.

Here, we used wavelet and spectral analysis on a range-wide dataset of abundance for the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) to test for regional differences in temporal cyclicity. Overall, we found that most populations (11 of 15) were cyclic at some point in a 50-year time series (1965-2015), but the patterns varied over both time and space. Several peripheral populations demonstrated amplitude dampening or loss of cyclicity following population lows in the mid-1990s. Populations through the core of the range in the Great and Wyoming Basins had more consistent cyclic dynamics, but period length appeared to shorten from 10-12 to 6-8 years. In one time period, where cyclicity was greatest overall, increased pairwise population synchrony was correlated with cycle intensity.

Because the major enzyme for yolk sac membrane cholesteryl ester synthesis is SOAT1, we cloned the avian SOAT1 promoter and elucidated the cellular functions of SOAT1. Treatments with either glucagon, isobutylmethyl-xanthine (IBMX), an adenylate cyclase activator (forskolin), a cAMP analog (dibutyryl-cAMP), or a low glucose concentration all increased SOAT1 mRNA accumulation in EECs from Japanese quail, suggesting that SOAT1 is regulated by nutrients and hormones through a cAMP-dependent pathway. Activity of protein kinase A (PKA) was increased by IBMX, whereas co-treatment with the PKA inhibitor, H89 negated the increase in PKA activity.

We illustrate this framework using a 35-y time series on gypsy moth populations. We demonstrate the demography accumulation curve in which the collective growth of the ensemble depends on the number of local populations included, highlighting a minimum but adequate number of populations for both regional-scale persistence and cross-scale inference.

Breeding season temperatures increased, being most pronounced in April. Although the onset of spring advanced nearly three weeks, the peak of mating advanced only 4-5 days.

Whereas the frequency of capercaillie broods was positively affected by rising temperatures, especially during the pre-hatching period, this was not the case in black grouse. Brood size, on the other hand, increased with increasing post-hatching temperatures in both species.

It was found that in total darkness or under selected light regimes (differing in colour and/or intensities), migratory birds display orientation towards certain ""fixed"" directions which do not correspond to the migratory or homing direction. This ""fixed orientation"" might correspond to the so-called magnetic alignment recorded in animals of different non-avian taxa. Here we demonstrate that also ""common"", non-migratory birds, pheasants, adopt a preferred position and body orientation when drinking at a circular dish. We recorded these parameters by means of camera traps in a pheasantry under control conditions and under experimental exposure to bright blue light. We identified three types of orientation at the edge of drinking dish: standing radially or tangentially with left or right eye to the dish. The position of tangentially drinking chicks was significantly non-random. While the position of radially drinking chicks was random under control conditions, it became significantly non-random, concentrated at about the north and south pole of the dish, under bright blue light. Our results show that this alignment has some similarities with the ""fixed orientation"".

To estimate effects of industrial activity and investigator disturbance on avian productivity, we monitored nests of greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons) with digital cameras and periodic nest visits during 2013-2014 at 2 sites on the ACP. A disturbed site was adjacent to human-made infrastructure and industrial clean-up activities initiated at the onset of the study and a control site was >2 km from sources of industrial disturbance. We assessed variation in estimates of incubation constancy, nest survival, and predator behavior relative to site, year, and distance from industrial activity using nest photographs obtained at 1-minute intervals. We compared analysis of hourly nest survival informed by intensive monitoring with cameras to analysis of daily nest survival informed by traditional nest visit data obtained at intervals of 5-7 days to assess how method and time scale of sampling affect ecological inference. Geese in both sites exhibited high levels of nest attendance and initiated incubation breaks less than once per day. Observer-caused incubation breaks associated with nest visits ((x) over bar = 37.8 min) were longer than other types of incubation breaks ((x) over bar = 8.7 min), demonstrating a differential response by nesting geese to direct human encroachment versus indirect vehicular and aircraft traffic. During both years, geese were absent from nests more frequently in the disturbed ((x) over bar = 0.9 breaks/day) than control ((x) over bar = 0.6 breaks/day) site, and this break frequency was slightly higher for nests closer to industrial activity. In the year with high rates of depredation, nest survival was positively related to distance from industrial activity and abandoned infrastructure, consistent with predictions of industry-caused effects. This relationship, however, was not evident in the year with reduced predation pressure, likely because of annual variation in arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) behavior. Analysis of nest survival probability informed by camera data allowed for detection of detailed patterns of variation that were not supported when using only visit data for the same nests. Observer visits were responsible for reductions of 7-35% in nest survival probability, highlighting the importance of minimizing, and controlling for, observer effects in studies of avian productivity. Indirect vehicular and aircraft disturbance posed less risk to nest survival than direct encroachment by observers at nest sites. Therefore, effects of industrial activities on avian productivity in the Arctic can be minimized through practices that limit direct encounters with nests. Published 2017.

We also conducted two detection experiments, testing the ability of 19 observers to detect bird carcasses. We used survival analysis and generalized linear mixed-effects models to investigate the effects of site, habitat, carcass size, and survey period on both carcass persistence and detection. We also investigated the effect of carcass age on carcass persistence and the effect of the observer on carcass detection. Our findings show significant variations in carcass persistence between sites and survey periods, as well as significant interaction between these variables. The daily carcass persistence probability was highly variable between sites, with an up to eightfold variation. Carcass detection increased with increasing carcass size and was significantly affected by the microhabitat surrounding the carcass; it also varied between observers. These findings suggest that both carcass persistence and detection vary strongly and unpredictably at a small scale. As a result, conservation managers should be encouraged to conduct carcass persistence and detection experiments on sites where they aim to produce unbiased estimates of bird mortality below power lines, and these trials should be carried out in conditions similar to the mortality survey.

These studies often use domestic birds as surrogates because carcasses of wild birds (e.g., raptors) are difficult to obtain. We assessed scavenger removal of carcasses from five bird species at simulated turbines to determine whether domestic surrogates are scavenged at a different rate than raptors, species of interest for wind turbine mortality. The percentage of carcasses scavenged during 14-d rounds ranged from 34.6% for American kestrels (Falco sparverius) to 65.4% for chickens (Gallus gallus), and the percentage of carcasses completely removed ranged from 13.5% for red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) to 67.3% for northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus).

The female views displays with 2 distinct eye types and can only perceive colors and fine patterns of male displays when they are presented in her frontal field of view. Whether and how courtship interactions produce such alignment between male display and female field of view is unknown. We recorded relative positions and orientations of both actors throughout courtship and established the role of each sex in maintaining signaling alignment. Males always oriented their displays toward the female. However, when females were free to move, male displays were consistently aligned with female principal eyes only during short-range courtship. When female position was fixed, signaling alignment consistently occurred during both phases, suggesting that female movement reduces communication efficacy. When female models were experimentally rotated to face away during courtship, males rarely repositioned themselves to re-align their display. However, males were more likely to present certain display elements after females turned to face them. Thus, although signaling alignment is a function of both sexes, males appear to rely on female behavior for effective communication.";"communication efficacy; signaling behavior; visual ecology; Salticidae; spider vision";2017;"BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY";"Behavioral Sciences; Biology; Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

In 2013 and 2014, we monitored 91 nests along a 24-km disturbance gradient leading away from the wind energy facility.

Instead, we found that the primary drivers of nest site selection and nest survival were related to landscape and habitat factors. Greater Prairie-Chickens avoided nesting near roads, with 74% of Greater Prairie-Chickens selecting nest sites > 700 m from roads. Greater Prairie-Chickens selected nest sites with more than twice the visual obstruction and residual standing dead vegetation of random points. Our results suggest that small wind energy facilities, such as the facility in our study, may have little effect on Greater Prairie-Chicken nest site selection and nest survival.

In contrast with previous studies, a recent analysis of faecal pellets and stomach contents of brown lemmings (Lemmus trimucronatus) reported a surprisingly high proportion (34-56%) of willows (Salix spp.) in their diet during both summer and winter in the Canadian high Arctic. To better understand the contribution of willows to the diet of lemmings, we designed a cafeteria experiment to determine which part of Arctic willows (S. arctica), usually the most abundant willow in the Canadian Arctic, were preferred by lemmings. We designed two types of experiments, one with flowering willows (summer stage; n = 10) and one with dormant willows without flowers or leaves (winter stage; n = 11). Lemmings preferred buds and to a lesser extent roots over woody stems in dormant willows, whereas in flowering willows, they preferred flowers and roots over leaves and buds. Our results suggest that lemmings shift their diet seasonally and prefer the fleshiest willow parts, i.e. flowers in summer and buds in winter. High consumption of roots by lemmings in both types of experiments indicates strong underground feeding habits. This behaviour could be favoured by geomorphological processes such as soil upheaves and permafrost thawing that often expose roots to grazing.";"Food limitation hypothesis; Herbivory; Arctic shrubs; Grazing; Diet composition; Population cycles; Lemmings";2017;"POLAR BIOLOGY";"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Seventeen broody hens were tested three times a day without their 3- or 4-day-old chicks. Hens were tested in two situations: chicks were returned either after each test or at the end of all the day's tests. As palatability influences food calling in maternal hens, experiments were conducted first with a highly preferred food item and then with the hens' usual feed. The chicks' capacity to respond regularly to their mother influences the hens' capacity to emit food calls. in fact, although the hens did not lose their maternal state, they uttered fewer food calls when their chicks were removed all day.

From hatching to fledging, they are involved in growth, development, and learning. We investigated the relationship between the ontogenetic patterns of steroid hormones and the sexual and social development of greylag goslings (Anser anser). Two groups of individually marked goslings (n = 10/5) were hand-raised under near-field conditions. 17 beta -OH-androgen (AM), estrogen (EM), and corticosterone (BM) immunoreactive metabolites were measured noninvasively by enzyme immunoassay of individual fecal samples. Feces were regularly sampled from hatching to fledging. All excreted steroids were found to peak at hatching and to decrease thereafter. Gonadal steroids fluctuated more than BM, which remained at low levels throughout ontogeny after a slow decrease during the first 20 days. The pattern of BM is discussed in relation to learning processes (i.e., filial imprinting) and social stress. It is suggested that high initial BM may constrain energy allocation to growth. AM increased around the age of 20 days, when the feathers start growing, and later, together with EM, at the age of 40 days. These elevated values of gonadal steroids are discussed in relation to the sensitive phase of sexual imprinting. Females show higher EM levels than males throughout ontogeny. Furthermore, the ratio of excreted estrogen to androgen (EM/AM) of females before fledging correlates with the number of hatched and fledged goslings in their first years of reproduction. In conclusion, our data suggest a role for steroid hormones in the modulation of behavioral and morphological development in the precocial greylag geese, in agreement with the organizational-activational hypothesis.

We investigated the effects of three types of host on the persistence of a tick-borne virus, using the grouse-hare-deer-tick-louping ill virus system of upland Britain. Each host differed in its interaction with the vector and pathogen. Grouse amplify virus only, deer amplify vector only and hares amplify both. Grouse alone suffer high virus-induced mortality. 2. An analytical model of the system was parameterized using empirical data from two wild populations with different community structures. By changing relative host densities we examined the conditions under which the virus would persist and considered the possibility of parasite-mediated competition between hosts. 3. Although deer alone and grouse alone were unable to maintain louping ill virus, a deer-grouse community usually allowed virus persistence because grouse transmitted virus while deer maintained the tick population. Since virus reduces grouse populations this is a type of apparent competition, and is unusual because deer do not amplify the virus. 4. At very high deer densities, the opposite effect could occur, whereby virus died out because of 'wasted' infected tick bites on deer, that do not transmit virus (the dilution effect). 5. In a hare-grouse two-host system virus usually persisted because hares amplified both the vector and virus (through non-viraemic transmission). Thus, apparent competition may occur between mountain hares and grouse. 6. The addition of a third host type increased the likelihood of disease persistence. Hares added to the deer-grouse system rendered the dilution effect unlikely because of additional virus amplifiers. Deer added to the hare-grouse system meant virus almost always persisted because they amplified the vector.";"louping ill virus; model; mountain hares; red deer; red grouse";2001;"JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

High levels of sequence divergence were found in both taxa (0.55-7.20% in black-browed albatrosses and 2.10-3.90% in grey-headed albatrosses). Black-browed albatrosses form three distinct groups: Falklands, Diego Ramirez/South Georgia/Kerguelen, and Campbell Island (T. impavida). T. melanophris from Campbell Island contain birds from each of the three groups, indicating high levels of mixture and hybridization. In contrast, grey-headed albatrosses form one globally panmictic population. Microsatellite analyses on a larger number of samples using seven highly variable markers found similar population structure to the mtDNA analyses in both black-browed and grey-headed albatrosses. Differences in population structure between these two very similar and closely related species could be the result of differences in foraging and dispersal patterns. Breeding black-browed albatrosses forage mainly over continental shelves and migrate to similar areas when not breeding. Grey-headed albatrosses forage mainly at frontal systems, travelling widely across oceanic habitats outside the breeding season. Genetic analyses support the current classification of T. impavida as being distinct from T. melanophris, but would also suggest splitting T. melanophris into two groups: Falkland Islands, and Diego Ramirez/South Georgia/Kerguelen.";"albatross; microsatellite; mtDNA; phylogenetics; speciation; Thalassarche";2001;"MOLECULAR ECOLOGY";"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

As a step toward identifying brain mechanisms responsible for recognition of conspecifics, we analyzed sensory cues critical for suppressing distress calls in socially isolated quail chicks at post-hatch day 2 to 4. Each subject of wild-type chicks was reared with another wild-type companion chick for 1-2 nights before tests. As the first step, we found that distress call was completely suppressed when accompanied by another wild-type chick, irrespective of whether the subject had previously been familiarized with the chick or not. When paired with an albino chick, on the other hand, the subject emitted significantly more calls, suggesting that the wild-type plumage is important. As the next step, in search of the critical sensory modality, we found that visual display of a conspecific chick suppressed the distress call even without accompanying acoustical stimuli. On the other hand, the acoustical stimuli alone were without effects. Olfactory as well as tactile sensations also proved irrelevant. As the final step, we tried to identify the significant sub-modalities in the visual images of conspecifics. Degraded visual image of a moving chick (degraded in fine details) caused a significant but incomplete suppression, whereas an anesthetized chick was without effects. On the other hand, distress calls were completely suppressed even without behavioral correspondence or exact plumage coloration. All of these data suggest that visual image of a moving chick should be given at a high spatial resolution, and wild-type plumage pattern might provide important visual cues.";"imprinting; emotion; cognition; hyperstriatum ventrale; suppressor stimulus";2001;"ZOOLOGICAL SCIENCE";"Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Though it never forms a jointed jaw apparatus, the L. japonica embryo exhibits the typical embryonic structure as well as the conserved regulatory gene expression patterns of vertebrates. The lamprey therefore shares the phylotype of vertebrates, the conserved embryonic pattern that appears at pharyngula stage, rather than representing an intermediate evolutionary state. Both gnathostomes and lampreys exhibit a tripartite configuration of the rostral-most crest-derived ectomesenchyme, each part occupying an anatomically equivalent site. Differentiated oral structure becomes apparent in post-pharyngula development. Due to the solid nasohypophyseal plate, the post-optic ectomesenchyme of the lamprey fails to grow rostromedially to form the medial nasal septum as in gnathostomes, but forms the upper lip instead. The gnathostome jaw may thus have arisen through a process of ontogenetic repatterning, in which a heterotopic shift of mesenchyme-epithelial relationships would have been involved.

We compare predictions of such models to the way poultry chicks (Gallus gallus) generalize to novel stimuli following appetitive training to either one or two colours. If the two training colours arc (to human eyes) red and greenish-yellow or green and blue, chicks prefer intermediates, i.e. orange rather than red or yellow and turquoise rather than green or blue. The level of preference. for intermediate colours implies that the chicks interpolate between the training stimuli. However, they do not extrapolate beyond the limits set by the training stimuli, at least for red and yellow training colours. Similarly, chicks trained to red and blue generalize to purple, but they do not generalize across grey after training to the complementary colours yellow and blue.

Here we present a review of our studies on the development of the lymphatic system in chick and quail embryos. We show that the lymphatic endothelium is derived from two sources: the embryonic lymph sacs and mesenchymal lymphangioblasts. Proliferation studies reveal a BrdU-labeling index of 11.5% of lymph sac endothelial cells by day 6.25, which drops to 3.5% by day 7. Lymphangioblasts are able to integrate into the lining of lymph sacs. Lymphatic endothelial cells express the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors-2 and -3. Their ligand, VEGF-C, is expressed almost ubiquitously in embryonic and fetal tissues. Elevated expression levels are found in the tunica media of large blood vessels, which usually serve as major routes for growing lymphatics. The homeobox gene, Prox1, is expressed in lymphatic but not in blood vascular endothelial cells throughout all stages examined, namely, in developing lymph sacs of day 6 embryos and in lymphatics at day 16. Experimental studies show the existence of lymphangioblasts in the mesoderm, a considerable time before the development of the lymph sacs. Lymphangioblasts migrate from the somites into the somatopleure and contribute to the lymphatics of the limbs. Our studies indicate that these lymphangioblasts already express Prox1.

We have grown two types of rat tumor cells, 10AS pancreatic carcinoma and C6 glioma cells, on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of chick and quail embryos. The suspended tumor cells rapidly formed solid tumors which invaded the CAM and were vascularized by CAM vessels. When grown on the CAM of quail embryos intratumoral endothelial cells could be specifically stained with the QH1 antibody. In C6 gliomas the vascular pattern was more regular than in 10AS carcinomas. The vessels often grew radially into the glioma and many of them were invested by smooth muscle a-actin-positive periendothelial cells. Lymphatics, which were identified by vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3) in situ hybridization were absent from C6 gliomas, although a weak expression of the lymphangiogenic growth factor, VEGF-C, could be detected in the C6 cells by Northern blot analysis. In contrast, 10AS cells, which expressed high levels of VEGF-C, induced ingrowth of lymphatics into the tumors, with BrdU-labeling rates of about 9% of lymphatic endothelial cells. Our studies demonstrate the heterogeneity of interactions of tumor cells with blood vessels and lymphatics and show that sufficient quantities and/or quality of lymphangiogenic growth factors are crucial for the induction of lymphatics in tumors.

B.t.k. kills larvae of Lepidoptera that ir-light otherwise be food. This may affect types of food ingested and influence chick growth rates by reducing the availability of a high-protein food. Amount of ingested grit, which is diet-dependent, may also be influenced, which could alter exposure to anthropogenic toxic metals, such as cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), associated with the grit. Chick growth rate from 0 to 14 days of age was determined, and gizzard contents were analyzed for types of foods and levels of macronutrients and trace metals in chicks raised in a plot treated with B.t.k. compared to chicks raised on a control plot. Chick growth rates were significantly different (p < 0.05); chicks from the treatment plot increased body mass 30% less as compared to chicks raised on the control plot. Control chicks contained on average 2.5-fold the mass (in g) of grit and nearly twofold the mass of food, which included larvae, in their gizzards compared to those exposed to B.t.k. whose diets were dominated by spiders and ants.

In contrast, control chicks had higher levels of aluminum (Al), Cd, cobalt (Co), and Pb in their gizzards than chicks from the sprayed area (p < 0.05), attributed to greater amounts of consumed grit. Although birds from the sprayed area had lower levels of the toxic metals Pb and Cd in their gizzards, a protein-deficient diet could have been a factor that contributed to decreased rates of growth in B.t.k.-exposed birds as compared to those birds held on nonsprayed sites.

An incipient endothermic response was noted when nestlings were 9 days old, and they became homeothermic at ages of 15-18 days. Respective mass-specific resting metabolic rates for nestlings 0, 15, and 45 days old were 47, 261, and 147% of the predicted value for adult noripasserine birds of similar body masses. Mass-specific minimal thermal conductance decreased from 366% of predicted adult value at hatching, to 220% of that predicted when nestlings were 21 days old. For nestlings 15 days old, the factorial metabolic scope (resting metabolic rate/peak metabolic rate) was only 1.5, but that increased rapidly thereafter. Rapid increase in the mass-specific RMR and decrease in minimal thermal conductance is suggested to contribute importantly to improve homeothermic ability during the first two weeks of the developmental period. At hatching, leg and pectoral muscles constituted 5.3 and 2.2%, respectively, of total wet body mass. Relative leg-muscle mass increased rapidly and had almost reached adult proportions when the nestlings were 25-30 days old. In contrast, pectoral-muscle mass increased in an almost direct proportion to the body mass during the first 30 days of the growth period, and increased rapidly thereafter. At hatching, the water fraction (water content/ lipid-free wet mass) was significantly lower in the leg than in the pectoral muscles (0.920 vs. 0.931). The water fraction of leg muscles also remained lower during the entire growth period. Judging from the proportionately greater mass and higher degree of maturity of the leg compared to pectoral muscles, the former would seem to be the main site of cold-induced heat production during early development of homeothermy in European Shag nestlings.";NA;2001;"AUK";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Breeding density in 446 study boxes declined significantly during the period 1987-1999, confirming other information indicating a long-term decline (since at least the 1970s) in the population. Mean AFB was 3.34 years when sexes were combined, ranging from 2-10 (mean 3.36) years in females and 2-9 (mean 3.36) years in males. AFB showed a significant linear increase with decreasing colony density, suggesting that increased stress on the entire population, such as that caused by decreasing food availability, may have prevented younger birds from attaining breeding condition at an early age. Median NDD was 8.84 m, ranging from 0-448.7 ms; two individuals of each sex recruited into their natal boxes. NDD showed a significant linear increase with decreasing breeding density but no significant linear or curvilinear correlations with mate fidelity, annual reproductive success, or lifetime reproductive output, A significant proportion (66.9%) of movements after recruitment (breeding dispersal) resulted in closer proximity to the natal site. Thus, although natal philopatry was strongly developed in the Cassin's Auklet, it did not seem to be adaptive. Those paradoxical results suggest that selective equilibrium may be acting on natal philopatry in response to the population decline: a low-philopatry, low-cost (later breeding and increased survival) strategy has become increasingly adaptive in Cassin's Auklets, explaining increases in AFB and NDD with the declining breeding densities. The lack of sex-specific effect's on AFB and NDD suggests that an even sex-ratio and roughly equal roles in reproduction among Cassin's Auklets exists on Southeast Farallon Island, and that inbreeding avoidance may be counter-balanced by relatively low mate fidelity in this species.";NA;2001;"AUK";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Thus, for a short period of time during the annual reproductive cycle, birds experience extraordinarily high demands for calcium. Two strategies appear to exist for meeting those temporally high demands. Some birds apparently seek out calcium-rich foods immediately prior to and during egg laying whereas others may store calcium in their skeletons over a much longer period of time, mobilizing those reserves only when they are needed for production of eggshells. In this study, we used dual energy, X-ray absorptiometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy to monitor annual shifts in bone mineral content in the legs of White-tailed Ptarmigans (Lagopus leucurus). The study organisms were known to live on calcium-poor soils. Despite an apparent shortage of calcium in their diets, the test subjects stored substantial amounts of calcium in their leg bones in months prior to reproduction.

However, in Thick-billed Murres (Uria lomvia), long-lived Arctic seabirds that lays a single-egg clutch, previous research has shown that early laying females will continue to relay until late in the laying period. Moreover, hatching success is similar between first and replacement attempts, as are nestling growth and survival, when parental quality is controlled. I compared survival between departure from the breeding site and recruitment age (4-5 years) for Thick-billed Murres that hatched from first and replacement eggs, but that were raised by parents that laid their first eggs early in the season. Replacement-egg offspring hatched and departed the colony about three weeks later than did first-egg offspring,but despite that, they were no less likely to survive to recruitment age. That result indicates that the potential fitness payoff from a replacement egg is similar to that from a first egg for the more capable members of the population.

Seven birds were fed commercial poultry food, seven natural food and eight commercial poultry food containing 6% of quebracho-tannin. Our results suggest that 6% dietary tannin, when added to a commercial food with high protein content, effects the grey partridge only slightly. No difference was seen in food consumption and body mass remained stable. However, birds fed tannin had longer small intestines, which most probably indicate gastrointestinal detoxication. They also excreted a high amount of tannin in their faeces. In addition, no between-group variation was seen in cytochrome P450 enzymes. Birds fed natural food had high concentration of nitrogen in intestinal excreta and high plasma alanine concentrations. They also suffered a rapid decrease in body mass after the change in diet and their body mass remained low. This may indicate increased protein excretion and/or catabolism of endogenous nutrient reserves. Potential short-term effects of the change in diet were seen in plasma.

This initiative is believed to have caused larger small game stocks and more regional synchrony in rodents. To investigate the effectiveness of the NPEP time series of predators bountied (1885-1914), rodent dynamics (1885-1914), ptarmigan hunting index (1885-1914 and 1900/1-1914), and willow ptarmigan and berry export statistics (1885-1914) were analyzed for three different regions: south, east and central Norway. In south and east Norway there were higher ptarmigan export in the period 1907-1914 than the years before, but not in central Norway. There was not bountied higher number of red fox, eagle or goshawk in any of the three regions when comparing years a) before and after 1900, and b) when comparing the periods 1900-1906 and 1907-1914. This suggests that predator removal was not the cause of increased ptarmigan export. The ptarmigan hunting index and rodent index for south and cast Norway were correlated in the period 1885-1914, while the ptarmigan export from east Norway was correlated with berry export from the year before. However, for central Norway the rodent index was not correlated with the hunting index. There were cross correlation between berry and ptarmigan export with lag from minus one to nine years for south and east Norway. The NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) - an indication of the winter weather variation - had higher values during 1900-1914 than 1885-1899, indicating moister and warmer winters in the last period. This analysis indicates that NPEP generally did not increase predator removal. The results suggest, however, that it was a series of years with high rodent density, that caused the increase in ptarmigan populations in south and east Norway, which, in turn, may have been caused by favourable weather conditions leading to among others good berry crops.

The data indicate that the golden eagle may be a particularly sensitive species to DDE.

In contrast to the duplicate cage procedure normally used in social learnin studies, four naive group members could freely interact with a tutor or a control chick in an enriched 20_M2 test arena. This arena contained two types of food caches with differently coloured food. The tutor was 3 d older than its group members and was trained to feed from one of the two food cache types, whereas the control chick was not familiar with the characteristics of the test arena and was either of the same age or 3 d older than its group members. During the first 9 d after hatching, the foraging activity of 32 chick groups was tested in 15 trials per group. Groups with a 3 d older but inexperienced control chick had the least foraging success whilst groups with a naive control chick of the same age compared more favourably with the groups with experienced tutors than with groups that included older control chicks. In a second experiment, a tutor compartment was introduced into the test arena in order to compare a situation of unrestricted contact possibilities with the duplicate cage procedure in which tutor and bystanders are separated by a Perspex divider. The tutor compartment was opened for some test groups, allowing free interaction between tutor and naive chicks. Those chicks which could only watch the tutor through the Perspex developed a preference for the tutor's food type and discovered this food type as fast as the chicks of groups with unrestricted interactions. However, a relatively large proportion of groups (3 out of 8) did not develop successful foraging behaviour at all, whereas the successful groups showed longer feeding latencies during the subsequent trials than groups which had unrestricted contact with their tutor. This indicates an inhibiting effect of the duplicate cage procedure. It is concluded that when testing chicks of a few days of age, a distinction should be made between (i) the social influence on food particle preferences and (ii) the social influence on learning where to find food. This is important for generalizations taken from duplicate cage procedures without any environmental enrichment, as this restrictive setting only allows detection of food particle preferences.";NA;2001;"ETHOLOGY";"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Over the last 25 years, populations of seed-eating birds have declined severely over most of western Europe. Local extinctions have occurred in grassland-dominated areas in western Britain, which may be influenced by loss in habitat diversity and a decline in the amount of arable cultivation. 2. We used the large-scale British Breeding Bird Survey of 1998 to investigate the importance of arable habitat within grassland landscapes for 11 common seed-eating birds and four similar sized insectivores. Generalized linear models were used to model the number of birds recorded in agricultural habitat within survey squares as a function of the amount of arable habitat present. 3. Numbers of grey partridge Perdix perdix, skylark Alauda arvensis, tree sparrow Passer montanus', corn Miliaria calandra and reed buntings Emberiza schoeniclus, yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella and whitethroat Sylvia communis increased with the amount of arable habitat present in a survey square; the numbers of house sparrow Passer domesticus, four finch species., dunnock Prunella modularis, robin Erithacus rubecula and blackcap Sylvia atricapilla did not. 4. The positive association between numbers of some species and arable habitat within 1-km squares was strongest where arable habitat was rare in the surrounding area, and weakest or even reversed when arable habitat was common. These results demonstrate the scale-dependence of bird-habitat associations in agricultural landscapes, only demonstrable where data are available at fine grain over large geographical areas. 5. These results support the hypothesis that range contractions (i.e. local extinctions) of some granivorous species have occurred because of contraction in arable cultivation. The loss of arable habitat where it is scarce may be causing declines in some areas, even though intensification of arable management is thought to be the main cause of declines elsewhere. Agri-environment schemes may need to vary between regions, for example to encourage arable cultivation in pastoral areas.";"agri-environment measures; birds of conservation concern; habitat diversity; mixed farming; seed-eating passerines; whitethroat";2001;"JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY";"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

I used statewide quail harvest data collected by Texas Parks and Wildlife (TPW) biologists to evaluate how severely daily bag limits and season lengths would have to be restricted before total quail harvest would be reduced. I assumed that regulatory changes must consistently decrease the number of quail harvested before such changes could result in increased numbers of quail available to breed-a prerequisite for increased quail recruitment into the breeding population over the long term. Reducing the daily bag limit from 15 to 8 quail likely would impact only 11 and 7% of northern bobwhite and scaled quail hunters, respectively, during years of average quail abundance. Because some hunters harvest more quail per day than others, these same conditions Would be expected to decrease northern bobwhite and scaled quail harvest by approximately 27 and 15%, respectively. A 6-quail daily bag limit might reduce northern bobwhite and scaled quail harvest, respectively, by 52 and 35% during a quail ""boom"" year, yet by only 43 and 16% during a quail ""bust"" year. Therefore, reductions in daily bag limits are regressive because they restrict harvest most when restrictions are least needed, vet decrease harvest least when restrictions would be most beneficial. Because <10% of Texas quail hunters spend >12 days in the field annually. small reductions in the season length would not be expected to alter harvest. If 1 week during the hunting season actually represents 2 days of hunting (a weekend), a 6- or 4-week season might decrease the number of days 10 and 19% of hunters, respectively, spend in the field, which could decrease the total quail harvest. Because quail harvest becomes increasingly additive to other sources of mortality as the hunting season progresses, those promulgating hunting regulations might consider eliminating hunting late in the season. since the ratio of increased quail available to breed would he greatest during this period. It is likely, however, that the only way to reverse rangewide declines in quail abundance is to increase the quantity of space quail can use throughout the year. It is doubtful that more politically palatable approaches, such as minor regulatory changes, will be of value by themselves.";"abundance; bag limit; Callipepla squamata; Colinus virginianus; harvest; hunting; hunting season; northern bobwhite; recruitment; regulations; scaled quail; Texas";2001;"JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Assuming that human-imprinted (hereafter, imprinted) bobwhite chicks foraged similarly to wild bobwhite chicks, we estimated foraging rates (arthropods [g] consumed/30 min/chick) and mass (g) changes of imprinted chicks foraging in different habitat patches, and used these measures to index arthropod abundance. Ranks of arthropod abundance in soybean fields (n=8) based on foraging rates of imprinted chicks were different from ranks based on arthropod counts from sweepnet sampling. Ranks of arthropod abundance in soybean fields (n=10) based on mass changes of imprinted chicks were different from ranks based on dry mass (g) of arthropods collected by sweepnetting and pitfall trapping. However, ranks of habitat patches based on foraging rates and mass changes of imprinted chicks were similar.

These rates were considerably lower than previous survival estimates for ruffed grouse chicks. Suturing transmitters externally was preferred over implanting them. Avian predators were the leading cause of chick mortality. Therefore, managers should consider the densities of avian predators when defining objectives for ruffed grouse recruitment.";"Bonasa umbellus; Michigan; radiotelemetry; recruitment; ruffed grouse; survival; transmitter attachment";2001;"JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

This results in profound sex differences in the quality (sex-specific) or quantity (sex-typical) of behaviors such as courtship, territoriality, or copulation. Steroids affect the brain by binding to intracellularly located receptors. The same brain areas express androgen, estrogen, and progesterone receptors in male and female brains. Sex differences in these genetically determined patterns occur in the size of neuron populations that intrinsically express sex steroid receptors. Further permanent sex differences are subsequent to degenerative fates of receptor expressing neuron populations during ontogeny. Transient sex differences in receptor expression appear to be due to area-specific up- and down-regulation of receptor levels, reflecting transient changes in the level of circulating steroids, changes in environmental conditions, or in the physiological status of the individuals. In particular, intrinsic sex differences in the expression pattern of sex steroid receptors and steroid-independent regulation of the expression level of these receptors in the brain are limiting mechanisms for gonad-dependent sexual development and activities.

The action of melatonin is exerted through specific receptors whose distribution and pharmacological properties have been extensively investigated. This review will focus on the distribution, sexual dimorphism, and dependence upon the photoperiod of melatonin binding sites in avian species with a special emphasis on Japanese quail. Melatonin receptors are widely distributed in avian brain. They are mostly present in the visual pathways of all the investigated species and in the song controlling nuclei of oscine birds. Sexual dimorphism of melatonin binding sites (higher density in males than in females) was detected in some telencephalic nuclei of songbirds, in the visual pathways, and in the preoptic area of quail. The last region plays a key role in the activation of male quail copulatory behaviour and it hosts a large population of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-containing neurons. Sexual dimorphism of melatonin-binding sites in the above-mentioned regions suggests a differential role for this hormone in the modulation of visual perception, gonadotropin production, and seasonally activated behaviours in male and female quail. Further studies are necessary to understand interrelationships among photic cues, gonadal steroids, density, and sexually dimorphic distribution of melatonin receptors. Microsc. Res.

We studied differences between red junglefowl, ancestor of domesticated breeds, and a modem White Leghorn laying strain with respect to foraging strategy, social behaviour and different fear responses. The behaviour of each breed was observed in four test situations: (1) a foraging-social maze of four arms where two anus contained easily obtainable familiar food and two contained hidden novel food, so the birds had to work to obtain it. One ann with each food type had a mirror, which provided a simulated social stimulus. (2) A hawk model test, where a hawk model was briefly presented while the birds had access to food. (3) A tonic immobility test, measuring passive fear responses. (4) A restraint test whereby the birds were restrained with a rope around one tarsus, measuring active fear responses. In the maze test, junglefowl spent more time feeding from the novel food site and next to a mirror, whereas the Leghorn spent more time in the arm with the easily obtainable familiar food and mirror. Both breeds responded on the simulated predator attack with an immediate decrease in foraging behaviour and an increase in ""walking alert"". After the model presentation, junglefowl walked alert and vocalised significantly more than the Leghorn, whereas Leghorn was standing alert more compared to junglefowl. It was easier to induce tonic immobility in the Leghorn than in junglefowl and Leghorn also had a less active response in the restraint test compared to junglefowl. Females in general tended to respond more active than males. The results on social behaviour were not clear. In conclusion, Leghorn used a more energy-conserving foraging strategy and was less active in the fear tests, compared to junglefowl. These results may be interpreted as correlated responses to selection for increased production, allowing modern strains to allocate more resources to reproduction and Growth.

Stegastes planifrons. These fish have individual territories, clusters of which occur on coral patch reefs. Fitness correlates varied with group position. Although. survival and age did not differ between fish resident in the centre or edge, central fish were larger and grew faster than edge fish. Central males also received more clutches, eggs/clutch, and cumulative number of eggs to defend than did edge males. The higher fitness in centre positions was then correlated with differences in behaviour by group position. Territories defended were smaller in the centre of groups. Aggressive interactions with conspecifics ere more frequent for central fish, but interactions with heterospecifics, and overall interactions, Occurred at Much lower rates for fish in central positions. Centre fish lost less of the algal food in their territories to intruders. Feeding and courtship rates, and forays from the territory, did not differ by position. These behavioural observations suggest that the positional differences in fitness measures and territory size are due to lower energy costs of territory defence for central fish, permitting the greater investment in growth and reproduction. Centre-edge differences in behaviour and territory size could be due to a selfish-herd-like group position effect (i.e. position relative to neighbours determines rates or behaviour). the microhabitat variation that was found between these positions, or a combination of both factors. To test among these alternatives, fish peripheral to a central treatment individual were removed experimentally, thus altering that individual's relative position from the centre to the edge of a group, without changing the microhabitat features of its territory. Territory size and behaviour measures of position-altered Fish changed in ways consistent with the interpretation that group position has a much greater effect on behaviour and territoriality than does microhabitat, Group position may thus influence the fitness Measures that differ by spatial position.

Alkoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (alk-ROD) activities of hepatic microsomes from Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) (HGs), Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) (DCCs) and chickens (Gallus domesticus) were measured using ethoxy-, methoxy-, pentoxy- and benzyloxy-resorufin, in the presence and absence of the inhibitors ellipticine or furafylline.

These studies considered various stages in the life cycle, including embryonic development, sexual maturation, adult reproductive function, and aging. A major focus of our research has been the role of neuroendocrine systems that appear to synchronize both endocrine and behavioral responses. These studies provide the basis for our more recent research on the impact of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on reproductive function in the Japanese quail. These endocrine active chemicals include pesticides, herbicides, industrial products, and plant phytoestrogens. Many of these chemicals appear to mimic vertebrate steroids, often by interacting with steroid receptors. However, most EDCs have relatively weak biological activity compared to native steroid hormones. Therefore, it becomes important to understand the mode and mechanism of action of classes of these chemicals and sensitive stages in the life history of various species. Precocial birds, such as the Japanese quail, are likely to be sensitive to EDC effects during embryonic development, because sexual differentiation occurs during this period. Accordingly, adult quail may be less impacted by EDC exposure. Because there are a great many data available on normal development and reproductive function in this species, the Japanese quail provides an excellent model for examining the effects of EDCs. Thus, we have begun studies using a Japanese quail model system to study the effects of EDCs on reproductive endocrine and behavioral responses. In this review, we have two goals: first, to provide a summary of reproductive development and sexual differentiation in intact Japanese quail embryos, including ontogenetic patterns in steroid hormones in the embryonic and maturing quail. Second, we discuss some recent data from experiments in our laboratory in which EDCs have been tested in Japanese quail. The Japanese quail provides an excellent avian model for testing EDCs because this species has well-characterized reproductive endocrine and behavioral responses. Considerable research has been conducted in quail in which the effects of embryonic steroid exposure have been studied relative to reproductive behavior. Moreover, developmental processes have been studied extensively and include investigations of the reproductive axis, thyroid system, and stress and immune responses. We have conducted a number of studies, which have considered long-term neuroendocrine consequences as well as behavioral responses to steroids. Some of these studies have specifically tested the effects of embryonic steroid exposure on later reproductive function in a multigenerational context. A multigenerational exposure provides a basis for understanding potential exposure scenarios in the field. In addition, potential routes of exposure to EDCs for avian species are being considered, as well as differential effects due to stage of the life cycle at exposure to an EDC. The studies in our laboratory have used both diet and egg injection as modes of exposure for Japanese quail. In this way, birds were exposed to a specific dose of an EDC at a selected stage in development by injection. Alternatively, dietary exposure appears to be a primary route of exposure; therefore experimental exposure through the diet mimics potential field situations. Thus, experiments should consider a number of aspects of exposure when attempting to replicate field exposures to EDCs.

Because the youngest nestlings in a brood are often at a significant disadvantage with respect to competition for parentally-delivered food, one might expect to find that mechanisms have evolved to alleviate the detrimental effects of hatching asynchrony and enhance the survival of last-hatched offspring. The musculus complexus, or hatching muscle, is responsible for breaking the shell during hatching and for dorsal flexion and extension of the neck during begging. An increase in its strength in last-hatched nestlings could therefore reduce the duration of hatching or enhance the ability to beg for parentally-delivered food, thereby enhancing the competitive abilities of those nestlings. I previously found in the Red-winged Blackbird Agelaius phoeniceus that the mass of the complexus increases with laying order and that its development is mediated by the actions of yolk testosterone. I investigated the hypothesis that yolk steroids also affect the development of the complexus in the European Starling Sturnus vulgaris. I asked, first, whether the mass of the complexus increases with laying order and, if so, whether this increase is at least partially attributable to a corresponding increase in the concentration of yolk testosterone. Because exogenous progesterone increases the water content of the complexus in the domestic fowl Gallus gallus I also asked whether an increase in complexus mass, if present, could be partially attributable to an increase in progesterone concentration across the laying order. I found that both yolk testosterone concentration and the mass of the complexus increased with laying order; however, there was no variation in the concentration of either yolk progesterone or the proportion of water in the complexus across the laying order, There were no differences in the concentrations of either androstenedione or 5 alpha -dihydrotestosterone across the laying order.";NA;2001;"JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

However, there are no studies on digestive enzymes during avian development, except for studies on mainly domestic birds that exhibit the precocial mode of development. We studied alimentary organ masses, intestinal enzyme activities (sucrase, maltase, isomaltase, aminopeptidase-N), and pancreatic enzyme activities (amylase, trypsin, chymotrypsin) during development of a wild passerine bird exhibiting the altricial mode of development. Wild nestling house sparrows were studied immediately after removal from the nest (days 0, 3, 6 of age; day 0 = hatch), whereas captives were raised in the laboratory beginning day 3 on a formulated casein/starch-based diet until fledging age (after day 12). Digestive biochemistry was dynamic. Tissue-specific activities of some digestive enzymes continued to increase through fledging, by > 10 times in some cases (e.g., sucrase and maltase in midintestine). Total pancreatic amylase activity increased 100 times between hatch and day 12 through a combination of increases in tissue-specific activity and pancreas mass. House sparrows differ from poultry, in whom after about 2 wk of age the specific activity of intestinal and pancreatic digestive enzymes is generally constant or declines during development.

In discrete time models, with overcompensation generating either cyclic or chaotic fluctuations in abundance harvesting can act as both a stabilising and a destabilising process. Maximum yields occur at the harvesting rate that coincides with the point where the harvesting stabilises the overcompensation. Optimal harvesting rates increase with the degree of overcompensation although these are more vulnerable to overharvesting. Harvesting in the continuous time model provides similar results, although observed hunting records do not appear to be stabilised by harvesting. Empirical data on the mortality caused by other natural enemies of red grouse, the hen harrier Circus cyaenus and the louping ill virus, show that these mortalities do stabilise grouse dynamics.

A simple harvest strategy would be to prohibit harvest in parts of the total area. We used a spatial model of a fluctuating population of willow ptarmigan, divided into 25 subareas to investigate the possible advantages of buffer zones in managing harvest. We let the breeding success be the source of annual environmental stochasticity but without any spatial variation. Survival was assumed to be density dependent over the total area, whereas dispersal was modelled as density independent. We then compared four major scenarios in which we let dispersal and harvest vary. About 75% of the area could be left open to hunting even if the level of harvest was close to the extinction level if executed in all grids. This harvest strategy would be particularly advantageous if the goal is to provide as many hunting opportunities as possible, rather than to harvest a maximum sustainable yield. Furthermore, it is quite simple and does not need a resource-demanding control system. We believe that a harvest strategy which sets aside a part of the area as a buffer, and places a limit to the harvest effort in the grids that are open for hunting, would be a cost-efficient system with only a small risk of overharvesting.";"density-dependence; density-dependent compensation; fluctuating environment; harvesting; spatial dynamics; Sweden; willow ptarmigan";2001;"WILDLIFE BIOLOGY";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The jump display was performed only in the presence of female at anytime of the day. Analysis of individual variations in display behaviour revealed that intra-individual variation was low compared to inter-individual variation, especially for the jump display. It is, therefore, possible that display rates provide information on male quality. Four male settlement patterns could be defined, singles, paired, lekking and satellite lekking, but only wing-flash display and stamped snort call differed among those categories. We suggest that satellite males are attempting to benefit from proximity to higher status males, in accordance with the hotshot hypothesis of lek evolution.

The retention of overt postembryonic rhombomeres (r) allowed direct visualization of the locations of neurons retrogradely labeled with fluorescent dextran amines from the midbrain oculomotor complex, cerebellum, vestibular nuclei, and spinal cord. Oculomotor projecting vestibular neurons were mainly located in bilateral r1/2, ipsilateral r3, and contralateral r5-8, and spinal projecting vestibular neurons mainly in ipsilateral r4 and contralateral r5. Vestibular commissural neurons were located in r1-3 and r5-7 and were largely excluded from r4. Cerebellar projecting neurons included contralateral inferior olivary neurons in r8 and vestibular neurons in bilateral r6/7 and contralateral r1/2. Mapping these results onto adult anuran vestibular organization indicates that the superior vestibular nucleus derives from larval r1/2, the lateral vestibular nucleus from r3/4, and the major portions of the medial and descending vestibular nuclei from r5-8. The lateral vestibulospinal tract projects from an origin in r4, whereas a possible ascending tract of Deiters arises in r3. Rhombomere 5 contains a nuclear group that appears homologous to the tangential nucleus of fish, reptiles, and birds and thus likely serves gravistatic and linear vestibulomotor reflexes. Comparisons between frogs and other vertebrates suggest that vestibular neurons performing similar computational roles during head movements originate from the same segmental locations in different species.

Intensive husbandry systems change rapidly, and the animals may have difficulties in coping with their environment and management.

Semen characteristics may indicate the Effect of genetic selection both on the productivity and fitness of the animals. Forty cocks of two genetics strains (an egg-type strain and a meat-type strain), housed in single cages, were used in the study. During the breeding period, semen was collected twice a week from each animal. Each cock was submitted to an open-field test and a tonic immobility test. The results show that strong genetic selection, carried out over a long period on domestic chickens in order to improve egg and meat production, seems to affect some aspects of behaviour. The reactions to the fear tests show many differences between the two strains in the open-field test, the egg-type cocks show higher levels of exploratory behaviour and lower general fearfulness (eg lower frequency of vocalisations and head movements). On the other hand, the meat-type cocks show a significantly lower duration of tonic immobility, indicating a lower level of fear specifically towards humans. Moreover, a key nearest neighbours analysis carried out using the behavioural data allows us to discriminate between the two strains with an error rate of 0%. These results suggest the potential for genetic selection aimed at reducing fear reactions, both towards novel environments and towards human beings, which may significantly improve the welfare of cocks.";"animal welfare; egg-type cocks; fear reaction; meat-type cocks; semen quality";2001;"ANIMAL WELFARE";"Veterinary Sciences; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Maturation/ age-dependent modulation of vascular lesions and a causal relationship between elevated BP and neointima formation, however, have not been clarified. We therefore intended to characterize, first, maturation/age-dependent neointimal plaque formation and vascular lesions and, second, their relationship to BP elevation. The BP measured in conscious domestic fowl, Gallus gallus, White Leghorn breed, DeKalb strain, via an indwelling catheter inserted into the ischiadic artery, increased with maturation in males; and at plateau level, BP (mmHg) was significantly (P < 0.01) higher in males (194.0 +/- 4.6, n = 11) than in females (169.3 +/- 3.1, n = 10). Neointimal plaques consisting of neointimal cells and abundant extracellular matrix appeared initially in the distal segment of the abdominal aorta (lesion-prone area) of chicks as early as 6 weeks old. The area (size) of neointimal plaques right above the ischiadic bifurcation increased with maturation, whereas the plaque area became smaller with some degenerative changes in adult birds. In some birds, diffuse subendothelial hyperplasia and more extensive plaque formation at the branching points of the aorta were observed. The plaque area appears to be larger in birds. particularly in males that have higher BP (r = 0.68). The width of aortic smooth muscle (SM) layers, measured in regions with no plaque, increased with age, whereas the number of cells per unit of area decreased, suggesting that hypertrophy of vascular SM occurs in response to exposure of the vascular wall to high BP. The number of cells was significantly (P < 0.01) higher in the plaque than in underlying aortic SM layers or in layers with no plaque formation. Both neointimal plaques and underlying SM layers are immunohistochemically positive for alpha SM actin, suggesting that neointimal cells are modulated SM cells, whereas the staining with SM myosin heavy chain antibody is low in neointimal plaques. Furthermore. plasma arginine levels dropped in accordance with the time of neointimal plaque formation, whereas plasma cholesterol levels showed an age-dependent increase. The results suggest that spontaneous development of neointimal plaques may be a consequence of exposure to high BP and associated local hemodynamic changes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Overall, bantams performed significantly more foraging behaviour than Hy-Lines. The fly-Line breed was more inactive and less involved in social interactions than the junglefowl and the bantam. The results support the idea that selection for high production results in modified behavioural strategies.

Information on the effects of wildlife predation on game and livestock is required to allow improved management of all organisms involved. Monitoring of prey, predators and predation mechanisms each suggests important methods, illustrated here by data from common buzzards Buteo buteo and ring-necked pheasants Phasianus colchicus. 2. Location data from 136 radio-tagged common buzzards, together with prey remains from 40 nest areas, records from 10 gamekeepers and vegetation surveys, were used to investigate raptor predation at 28 pens from which pheasants were released in southern England. 3. Among 20 725 juvenile pheasants released in 1994-95, gamekeepers attributed 4.3% of deaths to buzzards, 0.7% to owls, 0.6% to sparrowhawks, 3.2% to foxes and 0.5% to other mammals. 4. Fresh pheasant remains were found on 7% of 91 visits to buzzard nests, and 8% of radio-tagged buzzards had significantly more association than other buzzards with pheasant pens. 5. Predation by buzzards was most likely to be recorded at release pens with little shrub cover, deciduous canopies and a large number of released pheasants. The number of pheasants killed was greatest in large pens with extensive ground cover, and the highest proportion of released pheasants was killed in large pens where few were released. However, only 21% of 55 releases had > 2 pheasant kills per week. 6. Radio-tagged buzzards were located most often at pheasant-release pens with open, deciduous canopies. Pens were most likely to be visited by buzzards that had fledged nearby, but the proximity of buzzard nests had little influence on how much predation occurred. 7. Only a minority of buzzards associated frequently with pheasant pens, and predation was heavy at only a minority of sites, where pen characteristics and release factors probably made it easy for individual buzzards to kill pheasants. We suggest that the occasional heavy losses could be avoided by encouraging shrubs rather than ground cover in pens, by siting pens where there are few perches for buzzards, and perhaps also by high-density releases.";"cover; game management; prey density; radio-tracking; raptors; release pens";2001;"JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY";"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Differences in breeding strategies between birds and mammals reflect basic differences in biology. Avian breeding seasons tend to be of shorter duration and more asymmetric with respect to changes in photoperiod. Breeding seasons can occur at the same time each year (predictable) or at different times (opportunistic), depending on the food resource. In all cases, there is evidence for involvement of photoperiodic control, nonphotoperiodic control, and endogenous circannual rhythmicity. In predictable breeders (most nontropical species), photoperiod is the predominant proximate factor. Increasing photoperiods of spring stimulate secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and consequent gonadal maturation. However, breeding ends before the return of short photoperiods. This is the consequence of a second effect of long photoperiods-the induction of photorefractoriness. This dual role of long photoperiods is required to impart the asymmetry in breeding seasons. Typically, gonadal regression through photorefractoriness is associated with a massive decrease in hypothalamic GnRH, essentially a reversal to a pre-pubertal condition. Although breeding seasons are primarily determined by photoperiodic control of GnRH neurons, prolactin may be important in determining the exact timing of gonadal regression. In tropical and opportunistic breeders, endogenous circannual rhythmicity may be more important. In such species, the reproductive system remains in a state of ""readiness to breed"" for a large part of the year, with nonphotic cues acting as proximate cues to time breeding. Circannual rhythmicity may result from a temporal sequence of different physiological states rather than a molecular or cellular mechanism as in circadian rhythmicity. Avian homologues of mammalian clock genes Per2, Per3, Clock, bmal1, and MON have been cloned. At the molecular level, avian circadian clocks appear to function in a similar manner to those of mammals. Photoperiodic time measurement involves interaction between a circadian rhythm of photoinducibility and, unlike mammals, deep brain photoreceptors. The exact location of these remains unclear. Although the eyes and pineal generate a daily cycle in melatonin, this photoperiodic signal is not used to time seasonal breeding. Instead, photoperiodic responses appear to involve direct interaction between photoreceptors and GnRH neurons. Thyroid hormones are required in some way for this system to function. In addition to gonadal function, song production is also affected by photoperiod. Several of the nuclei involved in the song system show seasonal changes in volume, greater in spring than in the fall. The increase in volume is, in part, due to an increase in cell number as a result of neurogenesis. There is no seasonal change in the birth of neurons but rather in their survival. Testosterone and melatonin appear to work antagonistically in regulating volume.";"birds; photoperiodism; photorefractoriness; gonadotropin-releasing hormone; circadian rhythmicity; pineal; song";2001;"JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS";"Biology; Physiology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We compared the morphology and distribution of QH1-positive cells after transplantation of quail paraxial mesoderm, after blood transfusion, in quail-chick parabiosis, or after quail bone-marrow transplantation. After head mesoderm transplantation from quail to chick, we observed sprouting endothelial cells (ECs), capillary tube formation, and chimeric endothelial lining of large arteries in the host brain. These QH1-positive quail cells showed EC morphologies that demonstrated three different aspects of CNS angiogenesis: invasion by means of filopodia, clonal proliferation and tube formation, and integration into preexisting EC layers. After blood transfusion or in chick-quail parabiosis, blood-borne QH1+ cells were found in the lumen of but not integrated into the wall of the host vascular system. Neither were QH1+ cells observed in the capillary walls of parabiotic chick chorioallantoic membranes. In both cases, the quail cells showed typical macrophage morphology. In chicks that had received quail bone marrow transplants onto their chorioallantoic membranes, QH1+ cells with macrophage, but not EC shape were occasionally seen near the inoculation site. We conclude that (1) blood-borne cells do not become ECs or directly contribute to angiogenesis inside, or in vascular plexuses around the CNS during embryonic development; (2) blood-borne cells do not contribute to the intraneural macrophage population of the embryonic CNS.

From our 17-year field study ill arctic North America, we show that, unlike other birds, male rock ptarmigan eventually change from conspicuous to cryptic by soiling their plumage, thereby reducing their conspicuousness six fold before they molt to their cryptic summer plumage, individual males began to soil their plumage as soon as their mates began egg-laying, and were maximally dirty and relatively cryptic by the time incubation began and their mates no longer fertilizable. Thus male plumage conspicuousness appears to serve a reproductive function. Moreover. both polygynous and bachelor males delayed soiling for a few days after monogamous males, as expected because of the prolonged making opportunities available to them. We use these data to address a variety; of hypotheses to explain both the conspicuousness of breeding males and their subsequent plumage soiling. Given the high predation rate recorded for male ptarmigan during the breeding season, we argue that male conspicuousness is best explained by sexual selection and that plumage soiling is an adaptation that reduces predation risk by increasing camouflage.";"color; conspicuousness; crypsis; plumage; ptarmigan; sexual selection";2001;"BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY";"Behavioral Sciences; Biology; Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

In particular, short-term rhythms are expressed during early ontogeny, especially in broods of precocial birds. We investigated the relationship between the clarity of the ultradian rhythm of the activity/rest cycle of a group of young Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) and the level of social synchronisation and spatial cohesion between the birds within that group. The subjects were descended from two lines selected for either very pronounced rhythmic or arrhythmic circadian activity. We found a positive relationship between the clarity of the ultradian rhythm of the activity/rest cycle when birds were young and the clarity of the circadian rhythm of feeding activity when birds were older, but still immature. The temporal organisation of the behaviour of the chicks from these two lines was observed in outdoor aviaries, when they were 4, 8, 12 and 15 days old. The mean ultradian period expressed by groups of 12 chicks was variable, with a minimum of 6 minutes. The ultradian period lengthened regularly as chicks grew older, and reached approximately 40 min on day 15. The clarity of the ultradian rhythmicity of group activity was linked to the level of inter-individual social synchronisation and of spatial cohesion; the more pronounced the ultradian rhythms of a group, the greater the temporal and spatial cohesion of the chicks within the group. Moreover, these characteristics varied with the age of the chicks. Finally, chicks in the less rhythmic groups weighed less. These results stress the adaptive value of this temporal organisation strategy under natural conditions.";"ultradian rhythm; ontogeny; Japanese quail; social synchronisation; spatial cohesion; circadian rhythm";2001;"BIOLOGICAL RHYTHM RESEARCH";"Biology; Physiology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Unidirectional introgression of plumage traits from vitellinus into candei has created a region in which all definitively plumaged males have a collar that is lemon-colored. These males are nearly indistinguishable from white-collared candei genetically and morphometrically, but strongly resemble golden-collared vitellinus due to the introgression of secondary sexual plumage, traits, particularly the lemon-colored collar. The introgression could be explained by sexual selection for golden-collared traits or by a series of mechanisms that do not invoke sexual selection (e.g., neutral diffusion, dominant allele). Sexual selection on male-male interactions implies behavioral differences among the plumage forms-specifically that golden- and lemon-collared males should be more aggressive than white-collared males. In contrast, the nonsexual hypotheses predict behavioral similarity between lemon- and white-collared males, based on their nearly identical genetics. We tested the sexual selection hypothesis experimentally, by presenting males with taxidermic mounts of the three forms. As response variables, we monitored vocalizations and attacks on the mounts by replicate subject males. Both golden-collared and lemon-collared males were more likely to attack than were white-collared males, as predicted under sexual selection but not by the nonsexual hypotheses. Lemon-collared males were more vocally reactive than either parental form, contrary to the prediction of the nonsexual hypotheses.

Comparisons were made between changes in distribution and in abundance to determine whether these measures show similar relationships to environmental change. Local extinctions of selected species and reductions in species richness were significantly greater in the predominantly grassland region. Decreases in abundance were greatest in seven species in the predominantly arable region, two in the mixed region and nine in the grassland region. Changes in distribution and abundance showed consistent patterns in three species, turtle dove Streptopelia turtur L., yellow wagtail Motacilla flava L. and reed bunting Emberiza schoeniclus L. In another four species, grey partridge Perdix perdix L., lapwing Vanellus vanellus L., tree sparrow Passer montanus L. and corn bunting Miliaria calandra L., decreases in abundance were greatest in the arable region, yet declines in distribution were lowest. For other individual species, changes in distribution were too small to draw any conclusions in relation to farm type. We suggest that modern grassland systems are suboptimal habitats compared to arable or mixed agricultural land for many farmland species that occur at relatively low density in the more western, grass-dominated region. Declines in abundance are therefore more likely to lead to local extinction in these areas than in eastern areas where abundance is higher. However, the role of changes in grassland management on bird populations requires further research. It is suggested that conclusions drawn from changes in distribution alone, in the absence of supporting data on changes in abundance, may be misleading where the aim is to assess how large-scale spatial dynamics of populations relate to environmental change.";"abundance; farmland birds; grassland agriculture; macroecology; population declines; southern Britain; species distribution; species richness";2001;"GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY";"Ecology; Geography, Physical";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

APH says that densities of predators increase as a response to increasing vole densities and then these predators shift their diet from the main prey to the alternative prey when the main prey decline and vice versa. We studied the diet composition of breeding common buzzards Buteo Buteo during 1985-92 in western Finland. Microtus voles were the main prey and water voles, shrews, forest grouse, hares and small birds the most important alternative prey. Our data from the between-year variation in the diet composition of buzzards fulfilled the main predictions of APH. The yearly proportion of main prey (Microtus voles) in the diet was higher in years of high than low vole abundance. The proportion of grouse in the diet of buzzards was negatively related to the abundance of Microtus voles in the field and was nearly independent of grouse abundance in the field. In addition, buzzards mainly took grouse chicks and young hares which is consistent with the prediction of APH. Therefore, we conclude that buzzards are able to shift their diet in the way predicted by the APH and that buzzards, together with other generalist predators, may reduce the breeding success of small game in the decline phase of the vole cycle, and thus substantially contribute to the existence of short-term population cycles of small game.";NA;2001;"ECOGRAPHY";"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The probabilistic assessment indicated that risk to birds from exposure to granular formulation is small and that this route of exposure would not be a significant source of mortality. Similarly, the assessment of potential exposure of birds to food items contaminated with chlorpyrifos showed that the risk from exposure via food was small, even if it was assumed that birds feed only on the treated fields. Although they have potentially greater sensitivity to chlorpyrifos, effects in nestling birds consuming food items from fields treated with granular chlorpyrifos were negligible. However, risks to young birds may be greater where the major source of food is from fields treated with liquid formulations of chlorpyrifos.

There were no differences in clutch size or the proportion of eggs hatching between the two moors but brood survival was significantly lower on the dry heath. Radio-tagged hens with broods were monitored during the first 12 days following hatching; the chicks were captured, weighed and faecal samples collected. Invertebrate samples were collected within brood feeding ranges. Analysis of chick faeces was used to identify dietary components. Heather comprised the major dietary component on both moors. Invertebrates formed a higher component of diet on the wet moor, and this was positively correlated with growth rates, which in turn were positively correlated with chick survival. We present data from an experiment carried out in 1982, in which chicks showed higher growth rates with increasing insect availability. We also show that broods in which all the chicks survived (4-10 days) had smaller home-range areas than broods in which some of the chicks died during this period.

This method reduces the mortalities associated with piercing the vitelline membrane. Volumes of up to 50 mul can be administered directly onto the vitelline vessels for rapid absorption. Several experimental groups can thus be treated quickly and efficiently with various concentrations of the drug of interest. Detailed analysis of the effects on a specific stage or structure is possible by terminating development at that particular stage. Allantoic and amniotic fluids can be aspirated and analysed for specific metabolic products or markers.

Interplay between nest density and predators";"The suggested link between lemming cycles and reproductive success of arctic birds is caused by potential effects of varying predation pressure (the Alternative prey Hypothesis. APH) and protective association with birds of prey (thr Nesting Association Hypothesis, NAH). We used data collected over two complete lemming cycles to investigate how fluctuations in lemming density were associated with nesting success of greater snow geese (Anser caerulescens atlanticus) in the Canadian High Arctic. We tested predictions of the APH and NAH for geese breeding at low and high densities. Goose nesting success varied from 22% to 91% between years and the main egg predator was the arctic fox (Alopex lagopus). Nesting associations with snowy owls (Nyctea scandiaca) were observed but only during peak lemming years for geese nesting at low density. Goose nesting success declined as distance from owls increased and reached a plateau at 550 m. Artificial nest experiments indicated that owls can exclude predators from the vicinity of their nests and thus reduce goose egg predation rate. Annual nest failure rate was negatively associated with rodent abundance and was generally highest in low lemming years. This relationship was present even after excluding goose nests under the protective influence of owls. However, nest Failure was inversely density-dependent at high breeding density. Thus, annual variations in nest density influenced the synchrony between lemming cycles and oscillations in nesting success. Our results suggest that API-I is the main mechanism linking lemming cycles and goose nesting success and that nesting associations during peak lemming years (NAH) can enhance this positive link at the local level.

We used simulated (i.e., 3 chicken eggs) nests (n=840), 288 in 1995 and 552 in 1996 (n=420 nests in bunchgrasses, n=420 nests in prickly pear). Nests placed in prickly pear had a greater mean survival time (P<0.05) at sites with marginal nesting cover (<less than or equal to>754 potential grass nests/ha), but nest survival was similar at sites with more grass cover (greater than or equal to1,039 potential grass nests/ha).

All analysed sera were negative for antibodies against aPMV-1, while one bird tested positive against aPMV-2 and another two birds against aPMV-3.

Although the ecological effects of human impacts have been demonstrated in many studies, the socioeconomic drivers underlying these human impacts have seldom been studied. We developed a household-based, stochastic, and dynamic model that simulates the impacts of household demographic and socioeconomic interactions an fuelwood use, a key factor affecting the quantity and quality of habitats for the giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). Using Wolong Nature Reserve (China) as a case study, this model mimics household production and consumption processes and integrates various demographic and socioeconomic factors. Household interviews conducted in 1998 within the Reserve provided the data for parameterization. The simulation results fit well with both the data used in constructing the model and with a set of independent data. Age structure and cropland area were found to be the most sensitive factors in terms of fuelwood consumption, and thus deserve more attention in panda habitat conservation. This model could help reserve managers to understand the interrelationships among local economy, local cultural traditions, and habitat degradation, facilitating more scientific and economically efficient policymaking.

Although much work has been carried out on experiential contributions to the expression of such preferences, their neural and developmental correlates remain largely unexplored. Here we use embryonic neural transplants between two bird species, the Japanese quail and the domestic chicken, to demonstrate that an inborn auditory perceptual predisposition is transferable between species. The transfer of the perceptual preference was dissociated from changes to the vocalizations of the resulting animals (called chimeras), suggesting that experiential differences in auditory self-stimulation cannot explain the perceptual change. A preliminary localization of the effective brain region for the behavioral transfer by using a naturally occurring species-cell marker revealed that it is not contained within the major avian auditory pathways.

This paper describes two experiments, each involving eight groups of 100 non beak-trimmed birds up to 5 weeks of age, that assessed the effectiveness of these procedures at higher light intensities and with fluorescent light. Experiment 1 examined 5 or 10 lux of incandescent or fluorescent light. Experiment 2 studied responses to 5 10, 36 or 70 lux of fluorescent light. Individual inspections of the birds, for wing, tail and head injuries due to pecking, were conducted daily. Fluorescent light significantly reduced the incidence of tail injuries (P = 0.03), and tended to reduce those to the wings (P = 0.08), compared with incandescent light. No difference was observed between 5 and 10 lux for either tail or wing injuries. In Experiment 2, the incidence of tail and wing injuries was significantly and positively correlated with light intensity (tail, P = 0.05; wing, P = 0.02).

A key component of the sign stimulus concept is that some form of stimulus filtering occurs that is responsible for the marked selective behavioral responsiveness. Studies of immediate early gene induction in the avian brain in response to conspecific stimuli associated with courtship and mating reveal that such gene induction is highly selective. In male Japanese quail (Cotumix japonica), studies of the immediate early gene c-fos or zenk have been conducted in birds engaging in both appetitive and consummatory aspects of male sexual behavior. High induction of immediate early genes occurs in hypothalamic and limbic areas such as the medial preoptic nucleus, bed nucleus striae terminalis and parts of the archistriatum in birds who had copulated and/or who had expressed a learned social proximity response, reflecting appetitive sexual behavior. Immediate early gene expression was also increased in telencephalic areas such as the hyperstriatum ventrale that presumably plays a role in the integration of sensory cues related to female recognition. In European starlings, studies of zenk induction have been conducted in females who hear male-typical courtship song. Clayton and Mello had shown that zenk is induced in the auditory telencephalon of canaries and zebra finches at high levels specifically in response to conspecific song. Immediate early genes such as fos and zenk are also expressed in song control nuclei specifically in association with song production. In starlings it was found that song was effective in rapidly inducing zenk expression in the auditory telencephalon in males and in females in the breeding as well as in the nonbreeding season. Thus, the expression is not greater in females who use song to choose mates or during the breeding season when females are choosing mates. However, there is evidence that high levels of induction in certain areas of the auditory telencephalon in females are greater in response to songs organized in longer bouts that females prefer. Though immediate early gene induction in the brain does not exactly mimic selective behavioral responses to sign stimuli it may represent one important way in which stimulus selectivity of the sort hypothesized previously by Tinbergen and Lorenz is coded. Engaging in species-typical behaviors is also associated with motor-driven immediate early gene expression. Copyright (C) 2001 S.

We examined how parental nest attendance by lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) affected (i) foraging behaviours of arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus) and (ii) egg loss by geese exposed to arctic foxes at a large goose colony on Banks Island, N.W.T., Canada. Unattended nests and nests attended by single females suffered much greater egg loss to foxes than nests attended by paired geese. This resulted from foxes attacking unattended nests and single females far more frequently than expected by chance and from geese associated with such nests offering little or no resistance to foxes. Paired geese, in contrast, were avoided by foxes and also showed greater resistance to foxes than single females and unattended nests.

Six eggs each were in each dose group of coumestrol, ethynyl estradiol, indole-3-carbinol, o,p ' -DDE, p,p ' -DDE, or TCDD. Eggs were also dosed in two sets. One set was ethynyl estradiol (0, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10.0 mug/kg) and TCDD (0, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 mug/kg). This set was dosed below the air cell with corn oil as vehicle. Also, northern bobwhite quail eggs were injected in ovo with nine binary mixtures of six xenobiotics prior to incubation (coumestrol (0.3 mg/kg), ethynyl estradiol (3.0 mug/kg), indole-3-carbinol (3.0 mg/kg), o,p ' -DDE (1.0 mg/kg), p,p ' -DDE (1.0 mg/kg), TCDD (0.1 mug/kg)). The mixtures injected were p,p ' -DDE+indole-3-carbinol, coumestrol+indole-3-carbinol, TCDD+indole-3-carbinol, p,p ' -DDE+o,p'-DDE, p,p ' -DDE+ethynyl estradiol, coumestrol+ethynyl estradiol, coumestrol+TCDD, o,p ' -DDE+ethynyl estradiol, TCDD+ethynyl estradiol. Eggs were dosed once prior to initiating incubation. Quail were allowed to hatch and were sacrificed at 21 days of age. Blood, measurements, and tissues were collected. Survival was significantly affected by increasing concentrations of TCDD in ethanol as revealed by trend analysis. Survival was also affected significantly by o,p ' -DDE in ethanol but not by trend. Survival results of mixtures indicate significant differences among mixture, mixture components, and controls for coumestrol+TCDD, ethynyl estradiol+TCDD, and indole-3-carbinol+TCDD. Some trends from doses of single com pounds that are supported by results in the literature were observed for hatchling weight of ethynyl estradiol dosed females, weight gain of indole-3-carbinol dosed males, weight gain and liver somatic index of o,p ' -DDE dosed males, spleen somatic index of TCDD dosed males, and weight gain, gonad somatic index and egg gland somatic index of TCDD dosed females. In conclusion, the dose-response treatments appeared to have effects beyond effects on survival of in ovo dosed quail. For mixtures,plasma estradiol concentrations were significantly different among coumestrol+ethynyl estradiol, ethynyl estradiol, coumestrol, and vehicle treatments. Liver somatic index among the same treatments was also significantly different. Kidney somatic index among ethynyl estradiol+p,p ' -DDE, ethynyl estradiol, p,p ' -DDE, and vehicle treatments was significantly different. Plasma estradiol and plasma testosterone ratios were very different among o,p ' -DDE+p,p ' -DDE, o,p ' -DDE, p,p ' -DDE, and vehicle treatments. Coumestrol and ethynyl estradiol appear antagonistic for plasma estradiol concentrations and liver somatic index when both chemicals are present together. Ethynyl estradiol and p,p ' -DDE appear to act additively on kidney somatic index when combined together. Mixtures of compounds used in this study indicate effects very different from either or both mixture components, indicating the lack of predictability of chemicals when combined in mixtures.

This increase could result from either calcium entry from the extracellular medium or from mobilization of intracellular calcium stores. We have therefore examined the effects of dantrolene, an inhibitor of calcium release from the intracellular ryanodine-sensitive store, on these processes. Dantrolene, 50 nmol per hemisphere injected intracerebrally 30 min pre- or 30 min posttraining, blocked longer term memory for the passive avoidance task, whereas memory for the task was unaffected when dantrolene was injected at earlier or later times. Preincubation of synaptoneurosomes, isolated from the intermediate hyperstriatum ventrale IO min after training, with 100 nM dantrolene abolished the enhanced training-induced increase in intracellular calcium concentration elicited by 0.5 mM N-methyl-D-aspartate. By contrast, the training-induced enhancement of the alpha -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate-stimulated increase in intracellular calcium concentration in synaptoneurosomes prepared 6 h posttraining was unaffected by preincubation with dantrolene, which was not amnestic at this time. Calcium release from ryanodine-sensitive intracellular stores may thus be a necessary stage in the early phase of the molecular cascade leading to the synaptic modulation required for long-term memory storage.

The breeds were wild-type birds (crossing between red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus) and Swedish bantam (Gallus gallus domesticus) and domestic birds (Swedish bantam)), breeds representing an increasing level of domestication. Bantam birds have not been selected for any specific characteristics. The birds were allowed to forage in an experimental pen containing two separate food patches, which depleted as a function of being exploited, to see how well the different breeds were able to assess costs and benefits as the distance between patches were changed (short distance between patches compared to long distance between patches). Both breeds behaved in accordance with some general predictions of optimal foraging theory, i.e. moved between patches, left patches before these were empty and stayed for a shorter time in more depleted patches. Wild-type birds responded more than domestic birds to an increase of distance between patches, by spending longer average time in patch when there was a long distance between them compared to when there was a short distance. The wildtype birds adopted what seemed to be a more costly foraging strategy, moving more between patches than the domestic birds without ingesting more feed. During domestication, in the protected environment provided by man, individuals using less costly behavioural strategies may have gained increased fitness over those spending more energy on foraging. Although domestic birds still possessed the ability to respond adaptively to environmental conditions, the differences between the wild-type and the domestic breed might be a result of the reduction of the natural selection pressure which accompanies domestication.

Nest losses from predation were similar in large and small forest patches and lower in patches than in extensive forest. In general, predation risk was higher (and nest survival therefore lower) on forest edges than in forest interior, in short-grass pasture than in tall-grass pasture, in narrow corridors than in wide corridors, and on visible nests than on concealed nests. High predation risks in pasture habitat tended to increase the risk of nest predation in adjacent forest edges. For open-cup nesters, the risk of nest predation was relatively high in the present agricultural landscape, indicating that much of the available wooded habitat (forest edges, narrow corridors) offers poor nesting habitat, although it may be suitable for foraging and traveling.

Cholinesterase activity was measured in plasma samples (n = 65) collected from 54 individuals either prior to spraying, immediately (<24 hours) or 10 days after three spray events. Mean plasma cholinesterase levels declined significantly (P < 0.05, n = 12) to 61% of pre-spray mean activity (controls) immediately following the first spray event, but by ten days had recovered to 86% of mean control activity. Subsequent spray events caused no significant declines in mean plasma cholinesterase activity. Four of the 26 quail sampled within 24 h of a spray event exhibited plasma-ChE inhibition exceeding 50% inhibition. Radio-tagged quail (n = 25) were monitored throughout the breeding season to determine use of orchards and detect changes in use patterns resulting from the spraying of insecticides. Use of orchards by quail varied over the summer, with the highest use occurring in May, declining to very low use by July. Quail exhibited a diurnal pattern, roosting in sparsely forested uplands at night, travelling to orchard areas to feed early each morning and returning to roosts at dusk. Orchard use by quail differed during spray events compared to non-spray times. During the three hour period immediately after spraying (0530-0800), 14-20% of observed quail were in the orchard, after which use declined to <4%, and returned to 12% by the next day. During non-spray times, 3-13% of radio-tagged the quail were observed in orchard habitat, with the heaviest use (13%) occurring later in the day (0830-1700 h). Seven radio-tagged quail were predated during the study period. However, no deaths could be attributed to insecticide poisoning as carcasses were not in suitable condition for testing.

Territorial birds preferred stands of tall heather during the daytime in autumn and winter, but in spring they increased their use of heterogeneous heather/grass mixtures. Furthermore, in spring, females showed a very strong affinity for edges between heather stands of different ages, where they had easy access to nutritious young heather and good cover. When near the vegetation edge, territorial birds spent most time on the side of the edge providing greater cover. Broods occupied ranges in areas with rather more old heather and with more edge than was available over the entire study site.

The abundance of meadow pipits appears to be a good indicator of the breeding density of hen harriers on moorland managed for red grouse in Scotland. High densities of hen barriers can limit grouse populations at low density and reduce shooting bags, with repercussions for grouse moor management and conservation. We therefore examined the habitat characteristics of managed grouse moors, asking whether changes in vegetation could alter the ratio of pipits, and thus harriers, to grouse. 2. We examined grouse abundance and habitat on 69 sites of 1 km(2) in upland Britain,. of which pipit abundance was studied on 36. Similar data were collected on 73 sites of 25 ha within the Langholm estate in south-west Scotland, in order to make a within-estate and among-moor comparison. 3. The distribution of pipit abundance on the Langholm estate was similar to that seen in the extensive among-moor study. Pipit and grouse abundance were related to habitat in similar ways in the two data sets. 4. Pipits were the most frequent passerine, but their abundance was not related to grouse abundance. Pipit abundance declined with increasing muirburn and heather, but increased with grass cover. In a linear regression model Calluna, Sphagnum and muirburn cover accounted for 42% of the variation in pipit abundance across Britain. 5. Grouse abundance was influenced by the regional location of the grouse moor and to a lesser extent by its altitude. There were more grouse on English moors with less patchy habitats. Bird species declined with increasing Calluna and Sphagnum cover and habitat patchiness. Bird species diversity increased from west to east and on moors with more muirburn. 6. This study provides evidence that meadow pipits are influenced by habitat characteristics on moorland managed for grouse. This work also illustrates how habitat management may be able to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts: long-term increases in heather cover and management of this habitat by muirburn on grouse moors may reduce pipit numbers and thus reduce the ratio of hen harriers to grouse. However, the effects of such vegetation change on other components of the upland bird assemblage requires further investigation.";"Calluna vulgaris; grass; heather moorland; hen harrier; human-wildlife conflict";2001;"JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY";"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Breeding birds, vegetation and moorland management were surveyed in 320 1-km squares on 122 estates in upland areas of eastern Scotland and northern England where red grouse shooting is a widespread land use. We assessed whether population densities of 11 species of breeding birds differed between heather-dominated moorland managed for red grouse shooting and other moorland with similar vegetation. 2. We classified estates that had a full-time equivalent moorland gamekeeper as grouse moors. The mean density of red grouse shot per year was four times higher and the mean density of gamekeepers was three times higher on grouse moors than on other moors. Rotational burning of ground vegetation covered a 34% larger area on grouse moors than on other moors. 3. Selection of heather-dominated squares resulted in similar composition of vegetation on grouse moors and other moors (about 76% heath, 12% grass, 8% bog, 2% flush and < 1% bracken on both types). However, grouse moors tended to have less tall vegetation than other moors and differed significantly in some other characteristics of the vegetation, topography and soil type. 4. Densities of breeding golden plover and lapwing were five times higher and those of red grouse and curlew twice as high on grouse moors as on other moors, while meadow pipit, skylark, whinchat and carrion/hooded crow were 1.5, 2.3, 3.9 and 3.1 times less abundant, respectively, on grouse moors. The differences in density between moorland types remained significant (P < 0.001) for golden plover and crow and approached significance (P < 0.10) for lapwing and meadow pipit after allowing for variation among regions. 5. We used Poisson regression models to relate bird density to vegetation cover, topography, climate and soil type. After adjusting for significant effects of these habitat variables, significant differences in bird density between the two moorland types remained for six species, although their magnitude was reduced. 6. Correlations of adjusted bird density with measures of different aspects of grouse moor management provided evidence of a possible positive influence of predator control(assessed using crow density) on red grouse, golden plover and lapwing. The control of crows by gamekeepers is the most probable cause of the low densities of crows on grouse moors. There was evidence of a positive effect of heather burning on the density of red grouse and golden plover and a negative effect on meadow pipit. Multiple Poisson regression indicated that predator control and heather burning had significant separate effects on red grouse density. Significant relationships between adjusted breeding bird densities and the abundance of raptors and ravens were few and predominantly positive. 7. The results provide correlative evidence that moorland management benefits some breeding bird species and disbenefits others in ways that cannot readily be explained as effects of differences in vegetation type or topography. However, experimental manipulations of numbers of some predators and heather burning are required to test these findings.";"golden plover; curlew; meadow pipit; predator control; heather burning";2001;"JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY";"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Prior to the outbreak we had found 19 occupied Eagle Owl territories, and the owls had been feeding mainly on Rabbits. After the RHD epidemic, we found only six occupied territories and the owls were still feeding mainly on Rabbits. Diet composition was very similar between the periods, indicating that the owls did not diversify their diet in response to main prey scarcity. No significant differences in the proportion of Rabbit in the diet were found between the periods, suggesting that the impact of predation on Rabbits may be independent of the density of Rabbit populations (type I functional response). This response is not typically associated with generalist predators. In the territories that were still occupied after the outbreaks, the owls took substantial numbers of Hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) and Red-legged Partridges (Alectoris rufa). Rats (Rattus spp), a common alternative prey, were not taken in the study area. Six breeding attempts were recorded before the RHD, and none after the RHD. This leads a to believe that only the combination of Hedgehog and Red-legged Partridge availability with the readier availability of sick Rabbits allowed a small population of owls to survive in the area, but did not allowed breeding.

The function of the pineal organ synchronizing sexual activity and environmental light periods is important for successful reproduction. Comparative morphology of the avian pineal completes data furnished by experiments on some frequently used laboratory animals about the functional organization of the organ. According to comparative histological data, the pineal of vertebrates is originally a double organ (the ""third"" and the ""fourth eye""). One of them often lies extracranially, perceiving direct solar radiation, and the other, located intracranially, is supposed to measure diffuse brightness of the environment. Birds have only a single pineal, presumably originating from the intracranial pineal of lower vertebrates. Developing from the epithalamus, the avian pineal organ histologically seems not to be a simple gland (""pineal gland"") but a complex part of the brain composed of various pinealocytes and neurons that are embedded in an ependymal/glial network. In contrast to organs of ""directional view"" that develop large photoreceptor outer segments (retina, parietal pineal eye of reptiles) in order to decode two-dimensional images of the environment, the ""densitometer""-like pineal organ seems to increase their photoreceptor membrane content by multiplying the number of photoreceptor perikarya and developing follicle-like foldings of its wall during evolution (""folded retina""). Photoreceptor membranes of avian pinealocytes can be stained by antibodies against various photoreceptor-specific compounds, among others, opsins, including pineal opsins. Photoreceptors immunoreacting with antibodies to chicken pinopsin were also found in the reptilian pineal organ. Similar to cones and rods representing the first neurons of the retina in the lateral eye, pinealocytes of birds posses an axonal effector process which terminates on the vascular surface of the organ as a neurohormonal ending, or forms ribbon-containing synapses on pineal neurons. Serotonin is detectable immunocytochemically on the granular vesicles accumulated in neurohormonal terminals. Pinealocytic perikarya and axon terminals also bind immunocytochemically recognizable excitatory amino acids. Peripheral autonomic fibers entering the pineal organ through its meningeal cover terminate near blood vessels. Being vasomotor fibers, they presumably regulate the blood supply of the pineal tissue according to the different levels of light-dependent pineal cell activity. Microsc. Res. Tech. 53:12-24, 2001.

Fifty five francolins were trapped and marked with colour rings and small patagial tags, and observed in the field. The crested francolin lives in family coveys of 2-5 birds. The basis of their social organization is a male/female monogamous family system which appears to be the general pattern for a number of francolin species. The presence of a moderate degree of sexual dimorphism in plumage probably acts as a visual stimulus during courtship, with the male being attracted to the characteristic back plumage of the female. It is not clear from the survey whether pairs form permanent monogamous bonds. Courtship displays, male/male interactions, care of young and dynamics of covey structures are described. The mean winter territory during the non-breeding season was 155.3 ha. It was replaced by smaller breeding territories during the breeding season from October to March, which falls in the summer rainfall season.

A daily oral melatonin supplementation was then given to one group Of treated males (N=11) and the alcohol solvent was given to a control group of males (N= 10). These solutions were provided during the final 3 h of the photophase for 28 days, then during the final 4 h for 18 days. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to fat levels. However, 3 weeks after the beginning of melatonin supplementation, the sexual development of the treated birds slowed down. The importance of this decline varied to a greater or lesser degree between individual birds. When melatonin supplementation stopped, sexual development resumed. Activity recordings revealed a decrease in feeding activity when melatonin supplementation was provided. However, this response showed important interindividual variability. The birds that produced the most marked responses to melatonin during the first 3 weeks of supplementation were those that also showed the most obvious decline in sexual development. It seems that, in European quail, a wild migratory species that always shows a natural biological annual rhythm, a melatonin signal could play a role in regulating reproduction.

At the age of 68 weeks (generation 0, 1996), 35 weeks (generation 1, 1997), 30 weeks (generation 2, 1998), and 27 weeks (generation 3, 1999) female birds were transferred to observation pens and their feather pecking behaviour was recorded.

The selection criterion was breeding value estimated by animal model on the trait 'number of bouts of feather pecking per bird per hour'. Feather pecking behaviour in adult hens was significantly higher in HP than in LP.

From farms experiencing high mortality caused by cannibalism we collected cannibalistic birds, birds with injuries caused by pecking and control birds. All factors such as farm, bird hybrid and age were identical within a set of three birds, but differed between trios. Based on predictions from studies on wild animals, we hypothesized that cannibalistic laying hens would be larger and victims smaller than control birds, and that victims would in some way be less fit than control birds. In addition, since cannibalism in the wild is usually shown by individuals under adverse conditions, we hypothesized further that under commercial conditions cannibalistic individuals would be those that experience the environment as more stressful than others in the flock. Since fluctuating asymmetry is thought to be positively correlated with low stress-buffering capacity, we expected cannibals and victims to be more asymmetrical than other birds. As predicted, cannibals were heavier and taller than other birds and both victims and cannibals were more asymmetrical than control birds.

Local populations are often reinforced with captive-bred individuals, sometimes including hybrids between the red-legged partridge and the exotic rock partridge (A. graeca). Hunters and wildlife managers oppose releases of hybrids, but their identification by visual inspection is difficult beyond the first hybrid generation. Here we report the development of a set of RAPD markers to identify hybrid partridges using blood samples. We initially screened 46 RAPD primers on a subsample of pure red-legged and rock partridges, and finally selected six primers that produced 11 markers specific of the rock partridge. The selected primers were tested on hybrids of different generations bred in captivity. This set of loci permitted the detection of 100% (n = 31) Fl hybrids, 100% (n = 14) backcrosses of Fl to red-legged partridge, all but one (95%, n = 18) hybrid of the second backcross, and 18 out of 27 (67%, n = 27) hybrids of the third backcross. Efficient detection of backcross 1 and 2 individuals is essential, as these are the ones released for re-stocking purposes in hunting states. Although we have only used blood samples, other sources of high-quality DNA, such as muscle, should provide the same results. Therefore, it would be feasible to monitor the genetic purity of partridges in farms and hunting states at different stages of production, including embryos, chicks or hunted specimens.

We tested this by investigating how predators of goose eggs responded to lemming abundance on the Kent Peninsula, Nunavut, Canada, where nest success of white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons frontalis) and Canada geese (Branta canadensis hutchinsii) fluctuates widely. The main predators of both goose eggs and lemmings are arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus), glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus), and parasitic jaegers (Stercorarius parasiticus). Foxes responded functionally to lemming density: in prime goose-nesting areas they spent less time foraging during the peak lemming year than during the increase, and were seen foraging in prime nesting areas less often during the peak than during the decline. However, numbers of fox sightings in the study area during the nesting period did not differ significantly among years. The total response (functional x numerical) of gulls was lowest at the lemming peak and highest during the increase. The total response of parasitic jaegers did not vary significantly among years. Hence, we predicted that the number of nests lost to all predators combined should be lowest at the peak and possibly highest during the increase. During the 3 years of this study, loss of Canada goose nests was lowest at the peak but highest during the decline, and annual losses of white-fronted goose nests varied little. In cycles prior to this study, nest loss was high in declines but not particularly low during peaks.

Solutions to such different challenges may often be physiologically incompatible. For example, increased food intake and gut size are primarily responsible for satisfying the high energy and nutrient demands associated with migration in birds. However, short-term fasting or food restriction during flight may cause partial atrophy of the gut that may limit utilization of ingested food energy and nutrients. We review the evidence available on the effects of long- and short-term changes in food quality and quantity on digestive performance in migratory birds, and the importance of digestive constraints in limiting the tempo of migration in birds. Another important physiological consequence of feeding in birds is the effect of diet on body composition dynamics during migration. Recent evidence suggests that birds utilize and replenish both protein and fat reserves during migration, and diet quality influences the rate of replenishment of both these reserves. We conclude that diet and phenotypic flexibility in both body composition and the digestive system of migratory birds are important in allowing birds to successfully overcome the often-conflicting physiological challenges of migration.

The influence of the caecal nematode, Trichostrongylus tenuis, on male aggressiveness was investigated using two approaches. First, the territorial behaviour of a group of male grouse experimentally treated with an anthelmintic to reduce parasite intensities was compared with a Control group with natural intensities of infection. Second, the response of treated and control males to a novel conspecific territorial intruder were recorded using playback tests. Treated males, with reduced levels of parasitism won significantly more territorial contests than control males and produced more aggressive behaviour in response to the playback recordings. These results show that parasite removal enhanced aggressive behaviour.

Several VCRs contain androgen receptors, and gonadal androgens play important roles in the control of seasonal structural and functional changes of VCRs. Recent studies also found that adult VCRs are influenced by factors other than gonadal hormones, including photoperiod, but the relative importance of these factors and their mechanisms of action are poorly understood. To address this issue, we investigated the contributions of photoperiod and testicular androgens to the regulation of VCR volumes and to the control of song expression in adult dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis. Exposing castrated (CX) photosensitive males to long days (LD) enhanced their high vocal center (HVc) volumes compared to those of males held on short days (SD). These volumes were not further increased by concurrent testosterone (T) treatment, revealing a marked and gonadal androgen-independent stimulatory influence of photoperiod on the size of this brain region. HVc sizes were smaller in LD-exposed photorefractory than photosensitive males irrespective of whether birds were intact or had been castrated before photoperiodic manipulations, but HVc sizes increased in response to T treatment in intact photorefractory males. Thus, LD exposure can increase HVc volumes in the absence of gonadal T, but large volume induction in photorefractory males requires elevated plasma T levels. Testosterone treatment of So-exposed photosensitive males increased HVc, but not Area X, MAN, or RA volumes. Only T-treated males sang and this treatment given to castrates was equally effective behaviorally when administered to photosensitive, photostimulated, or photorefractory juncos. This result indicates that the stimulating influence of LD exposure on HVc volumes is insufficient to induce song in the absence of elevated plasma T levels.

Yet, they must also grow rapidly to achieve independence before the end of the short arctic growing season. A rapid growth rate may conflict with development of mature function, and because of the allometric scaling of thermal relationships, this trade-off might be resolved differently in large and small species. We assessed growth (mass) and functional maturity (catabolic enzyme activity) in leg and pectoral muscles of chicks aged 1-16 d and adults of two scolopacid shorebirds, the smaller dunlin (Calidris alpina: neonate mass 8 g, adult mass 50 g) and larger whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus; neonate mass 34 g, adult mass 380 g). Enzyme activity indicates maximum catabolic capacity, which is one aspect of the development of functional maturity of muscle. The growth rate-maturity hypothesis predicts that the development of catabolic capacity should be delayed in faster-growing muscle masses. Leg muscles of both species were a larger proportion of adult size at hatching and grew faster than pectoral muscles. Pectoral muscles grew more rapidly in the dunlin than in the whimbrel, whereas leg muscles grew more rapidly in the whimbrel. In both species and in both leg and pectoral muscles, enzyme activities generally increased with age, suggesting increasing functional maturity. Levels of citrate synthase activity were similar to those reported for other species, but L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA-dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase (PK) activities were comparatively high. Catabolic capacities of leg muscles were initially high compared to those of pectoral muscles, but with the exception of glycolytic (PK) capacities, these subsequently increased only modestly or even decreased as chicks grew. The earlier functional maturity of the more rapidly growing leg muscles, as well as the generally higher functional maturity in muscles of the more rapidly growing dunlin chicks, contradicts the growth rate-maturity function trade-off and suggests that birds have considerable latitude to modify this relationship. Whimbrel chicks, apparently, can rely on allometric scaling of power requirements for locomotion and the thermal inertia of their larger mass to reduce demands on their muscles, whereas dunlin chicks require muscles with higher metabolic capacity from an earlier age.

This paper gives an account of hunting disturbance, timing of autumn migration and refuge use in Anas species in eutrophic wetlands in central Finland (63 degreesN, 27 degreesE) during 1995-1999. Based on the timing of migration, duck species may be divided into early and late migrants. In two lakes (total area 2.2 km(2)) which were monitored on a weekly basis during 1995-1998, numbers of late migrants, i.e. mallard Anas platyrhynchos, teal Anas crecca and wigeon Anas penelope, increased towards the opening of hunting season on 20 August, whereas shoveler Anas clypeata, pintail Anas acuta and garganey Anas querquedula migrated early, and peak numbers of these species occurred already in the beginning of August. Consequently, in Finland's inland lake area, hunting disturbance relates differently to early and late migrating species. Immediately after the opening of the season the numbers of dabbling ducks collapsed and the average numbers in the wetlands were only 9.3% of the numbers present at the end of the protection period in 1995-1998. A corresponding decrease in numbers occurred in 13 lakes (total area 8.5 km(2)) in the Finnish inland lake district in 1999. After the beginning of the open season numbers of wigeon, teal and mallard decreased in unprotected areas,but increased in a refuge area. In Finland, refuge areas with high-quality foraging and moulting habitats for waterfowl are few, so a network of waterfowl reserves could mitigate the effects of hunting disturbance.";"disturbance; hunting; migration; reserve; waterfowl";2001;"WILDLIFE BIOLOGY";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Based on the mast depression hypothesis, it was predicted that adverse weather conditions should have less influence on the reproduction and thus also on the autumn population size in postmast years of bilberry Vaccinum myrtillus than in other years,because of a higher food quality and therefore also a higher body condition of the birds. In a logistic regression model, only the bilberry index and the June-September temperature of the previous year contributed significantly to explain the status of the capercaillie population. A negative effect of high summer temperatures in the previous year was highly significant when analysing post-mast years separately, possibly because bilberry plants were less depressed after a high seed crop if summer temperatures and thus primary production were high. Only when years with high bilberry production were analysed separately, did I find effects of weather conditions which could be assumed to have direct impacts on breeding success, such as snow conditions in spring and precipitation in early summer.";"bilberry masting; mast depression hypothesis; plant quality; population fluctuation; Tetrao urogallus; weather";2001;"WILDLIFE BIOLOGY";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

In the prairie, predation problems are often related to large-scale habitat degradation coupled with changes in predator communities.

In this review, we examine the role of predation in quail management. Predation is the major source of nest loss and of mortality for young and adult quail. Mean nest success across studies reviewed was 28%. Estimates of annual survival rates have varied from 5 to 26% for radiotelemetry studies and from 15 to 30% based on age-ratio studies. Breeding season survival estimates ranged from 13 to 51% in telemetry studies reviewed. Brood survival is the least studied aspect of quail survival; estimates ranged from 13 to 47%. Mammalian predators most often implicated in nest predation include striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), raccoons (Procyon lotor), opossums (Didelphis virginianus), foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus and Vulpes vulpes), coyotes (Canis latrans), and feral hogs (Sus scrofa). Accipiters (Accipiter spp.) and northern harriers (Circus cyaneus) are the most common avian predators of quail. Less information is available to assess impact of predation on scaled quail, but observations from areas where bobwhites and scaled quail are sympatric suggested that scaled quail are less vulnerable to predation than bobwhites. Although quail have adapted to cope with high predation rates (e.g., renesting, large clutches), populations in some areas may be suppressed by predation. Changes in land use, management practices, and predator communities interact to depress quail populations over much of the bobwhite's range. Additional studies are needed to assess the role of predation and predation management in Light of these landscape-level changes. A variation of the Integrated Pest Management philosophy used in crop production is proposed as an appropriate model to address predation management for quail.";"avian recruitment; Callipepla squamata; Colinus virginianus; game birds; Integrated Pest Management; mesomammals; northern bobwhite; population regulation; predation; raptors; scaled quail";2001;"WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN";"Biodiversity Conservation";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Runway tests that require chicks to traverse a corridor in order to reach other chicks in a goal box are commonly used to measure this behavioural trait. However, we need to determine if the chicks' responses in such tests are sensitive to certain experiential variables before we can recommend possible selection criteria for future breeding programmes. The present study focused on fear and on the identity of the stimulus birds. Broiler chicks either remained undisturbed or were exposed to an acute stressor (mechanical restraint) before their tonic immobility fear responses were measured 1 h later in Experiment 1. Exposure to the stressor significantly prolonged tonic immobility and, hence, presumably, underlying fear levels. In Experiment 2, the responses of stressed chicks and undisturbed controls were assessed when they were tested individually in a runway with a goal box containing either familiar or unfamiliar chicks of the same age. Our finding that stressed chicks emerged from the start box sooner and spent longer near the stimulus birds suggests that exposure to a frightening event increased social reinstatement motivation. Furthermore, social affiliation was more pronounced when the goal box contained familiar cagemates rather than strange chicks, regardless of prior treatment. This finding demonstrates that broiler chicks that were housed in groups of twelve can discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics encountered in novel surroundings. Thus, sociality was positively associated with fearfulness and broilers clearly showed social discrimination in runway tests. These findings highlight the dangers of disregarding variables, such as fear and the capacity for social recognition in tests of social motivation. We strongly recommend that exposure to frightening events prior to test should be avoided and that the identity of the birds in the runway goal box should be standardized, i.e. either familiar or unfamiliar, and noted.

We aimed to evaluate the possible fate of arctic fox populations using discrete-time models including both demographic and environmental variability. Because the reproduction of arctic fox in Scandinavia is dependent on the abundance of small rodents, which is cyclic, we included the temporal variability of reproductive performances in our viability analysis based on time series available for three Scandinavian populations. Whatever the modelling of the reproductive performances and the range of adult survival rates considered, the risks of extinction were high. They were very sensitive to adult survival rates and variability in reproductive performances. Populations with the longest duration between two successful reproductions were at the greatest risks of extinction.

I examined the effect of castration on plumage expression in Gambel's Quail (Callipepla gambelii), a species in which males are highly ornate, and in Scaled Quail (C. squamata), an unornamented species. Using male pairs, each consisting of a castrate and a control, I also assessed whether castration affected (1) the behavior of males, (2) the mating decisions of females, or (3) the outcome of male-male competition. Castration did not alter the plumage of male Gambel's or Scaled Quail. in these species, and some other members of the avian order Galliformes, production of ornate plumage appears to be independent of testosterone. In contrast, castration reduced or eliminated courtship behaviors. Females almost never preferred castrated individuals. During male-male competition, castrates also exhibited lower rates of threat behaviors, which appear to be identical to those used during courtship. Castration did not, however, influence the outcome of male-male competition. Castrates of both species exhibited overt aggression (pecks, chases, displacement) and frequently won male contests. Such results suggest that certain types of aggressive behavior may be testosterone-independent. In both Gambel's and Scaled Quail, male body size correlated positively with dominant individuals.

However, only one of them unites with the female pronucleus to form a zygote nucleus; the supernumerary spermatozoal nuclei degenerate at the early cleavage stages. To establish a factor responsible for spermatozoal degeneration, the presence of DNase activity was studied in vitro in extracts of Japanese quail oocytes using lambda DNA/HindIII as a substrate. The experimental conditions were designed to reveal the presence of either DNase I or DNase II activities, separately. Degradation of the substrate DNA was evaluated by electrophoresis on agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. high activities of DNase I and DNase II were found in the germinal discs of the largest vitellogenic oocytes. DNase I activity was estimated to be about 3 x 10(-3) Kunitz units and DNase II about 4 x 10(-2) Kunitz units per germinal disc. DNase I activity in an oocyte seems to increase during oogenesis since DNA degradation by the extracts from the germinal discs of the largest vitellogenic oocytes was much higher than by those from previtellogenic and small vitellogenic oocytes. The presence of high DNase I and II activities in the largest vitellogenic oocytes would point to their role in degradation of DNA from supernumerary spermatozoa entering the ovum during polyspermic fertilisation in birds. The enzymes could be a factor, or one of the factors, in the late block to polyspermy in the cytoplasm of avian eggs. It is suggested here that the DNase activities might also be responsible for poor efficiency in obtaining transgenic birds by microinjection of exogenous DNA into the fertilised chick ovum.";"DNase; Japanese quail; oocyte; polyspermy";2001;"ZYGOTE";"Cell Biology; Developmental Biology; Reproductive Biology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

However, the variable behaviour of the stimulus birds can influence the approach/avoidance responses of the test birds and thereby confound the results. Because chickens modify their behaviour readily and appropriately to a variety of video images, including social stimuli, we asked if video playback might represent easily controllable and standardized alternatives to live birds. Female ISA Brown chicks were housed in groups of eight and then exposed to a blank illuminated television for 10 min per day from 2 to 7 days of age. At 8 or 9 days of age they were placed individually in the start box of a 1.6 m long runway and we recorded their responses to a monitor displaying selected video images that was situated in the goal box at the opposite end of the runway. In Experiment 1 chicks approached a monitor playing the video image and soundtrack of feeding chicks significantly sooner than one of a goal box with the food dish and background noise. In Experiment 2, chicks were exposed to the same video of feeding conspecifics with or without the associated sounds or to a video of the goal box with or without the chick soundtrack. Both the videos of other chicks elicited faster approach than did those of the goal box and the sound and silent versions were equally attractive. Adding the soundtrack of feeding chicks to the goal-box video failed to increase its attractiveness. The present results suggest that chicks are attracted towards televised images of other chicks. They also indicate that the visual and auditory components of the video stimuli did not exert additive effects and that approach reflected attraction to the visual image. Collectively, our findings suggest that video playback of selected social stimuli, such as feeding conspecifics, could be a valuable tool in tests requiring voluntary locomotion along a predetermined path.

We designed two experiments to test for similar effects of pyrazine on the conspicuousness of prey, perhaps the most ubiquitous aspect of aposematic coloration. In the first experiment, we offered predators (Gallus gallus domesticus) a choice between conspicuous crumbs and cryptic crumbs in the presence or absence of pyrazine. In the second experiment, we manipulated the birds' experience of conspicuous prey during an initial training phase. Only in the presence of pyrazine did birds show a bias against conspicuously coloured food, and this occurred whether or not they had previously experienced food that contrasted with the background This emergent behaviour relied upon the visual and odorous signal components being presented together.

Their response to predators was tested in a large outdoor aviary set in natural rainforest habitat. Two living predators, a cat and a dog, as well as a moving rubber snake and raptor silhouette were presented to observe whether different predators evoked different innate responses. Controls consisted of cardboard boxes: of equal coloration, shape and dimensions. Ten chicks were tested per. stimulus type, and their response measured as latency to the first step and proportion of time spent performing different behaviours, during presentation of the stimuli and thereafter While the snake evoked mainly running and this was obvious only during the test, the three other stimuli also led to a difference in behaviour after presentation. The raptor and cat evoked more crouching than other stimuli and the dog more running. Latency to the first step was higher in the raptor tests than during others. However, there was no difference in response between the stimuli and controls, suggesting that the releasing mechanism for evoking a response is likely to be size, dimensions, height and/or relative speed. Hatchlings were also presented with an acoustical stimulus, alarm calls of songbirds; its control was white noise. They responded to this by being more vigilant than in other tests, and, as with the snake, this response was only obvious during the test. In contrast to the optical stimuli, chicks did not respond to the control for the acoustical stimulus, indicating that megapode chicks, which have no parents to warn them, possess an innate response to alarm calls of songbirds instead. The results of this study also suggest that a lack of predator recognition should be of little concern in the translocation of endangered megapode species, even when chicks have to deal with introduced predators, and that other factors such as the availability of cover should be given greater attention.";NA;2001;"BEHAVIOUR";"Behavioral Sciences; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Developmentally, the pharynx arises from the pharyngeal arches on either side of the head of vertebrate embryos. The development of the pharyngeal arches is complex involving a number of disparate embryonic populations, ectoderm, endoderm, neural crest and mesoderm, which must be co-ordinated to generate the components and overall identity of each of the arches. Previous studies suggested that it is the neural crest that plays a pivotal role in patterning the pharyngeal arches. It is now also becoming clear, however, that there are crest-independent patterning mechanisms. Therefore, pharyngeal arch patterning is more complex than was previously believed and there must be an integration of crest-dependent and -independent patterning mechanisms.

The extent of habitat lost, over 90% in some regions, has led to the local extinction of some bird species, simply through random sampling effects. Habitat specialists and those that move sequentially among several habitats, are especially at risk, as some habitats have been lost disproportionally. Fragmentation introduces additional problems by subdividing populations into small, isolated sub-populations. Whereas some of the remaining species of birds appear able to move through highly fragmented landscapes, it is possible that they suffer high mortality while doing so. Some species that have been lost regionally may have had difficulty dispersing, but there have been few detailed studies of the demography of Australian birds in fragmented landscapes. Such studies are necessary before we can assess the value of corridors, or other means, to assist dispersal of birds. Fragmentation also leads to edge effects, which, when compounded by habitat degradation, may alter the intensity of a number of ecological processes. There is circumstantial evidence suggesting that loss of nest sites and increased predation on nests and free-living birds have contributed to the decline of woodland birds. Increased interspecific competition, for instance with noisy miners Manorina melanocephala, may also have a major impact on smaller insectivores and honeyeaters. Effects of parasites and disease have barely been studied in Australia, though brood parasitism could account for local losses. Dieback of eucalypts and loss of understorey are common in fragmented and degraded landscapes and are associated with a greatly reduced diversity of birds. The effect of fragmentation and degradation on food has received minimal attention. We propose further research that tests the importance of some of these ecological processes in causing the decline and loss of bird species in agricultural woodlands. Although management should proceed immediately, including a cessation of any further clearing of native vegetation, it should be conducted in conjunction with research. We suggest how the findings of research can inform managers, which will make management more effective in achieving conservation of regional avifaunas. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The research reported here was conducted in an effort to clone quail RAR beta cDNA (qRAR beta) and to evaluate the expression of qRAR beta mRNAs in different tissues and during the development of gonadotropic organs. Two complete cDNAs of qRAR beta1 and qRAR beta2 were isolated by a combination of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and 5'- and 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends techniques. An RNase protection assay revealed the widespread expression of qRAR beta1 and beta2 with large tissue-specific variations. The qRAR beta1 isoform was predominant in the testis, whereas qRAR beta2 was dominant in the other tissues examined with the exception of the brain, where both isoforms were almost equally expressed. In the developing testes, the qRAR beta1 mRNA level was high between 30 and 40 days of age, the period during which the testes grew rapidly. The level declined thereafter to its initial level. In contrast, qRAR beta2 mRNA did not exhibit obvious changes. In the developing oviducts, both qRAR beta1 and beta2 mRNAs reached their peak levels by 30 days of age, just before the rapid development of the oviduct occurred, and then decreased to almost undetectable levels when the oviduct developed to the laying stage (over 2.88 g in weight). Similar expression patterns of qRAR beta1 and beta2 were also observed in the developing follicles from the prehierarchical (<2-mm diameter) to the largest preovulatory follicle. In contrast, neither qRAR<beta>1 nor beta2 mRNA exhibited developmental changes in the brain.

Pigeons were trained on spatial discrimination with or without added color cues using a repeated acquisition procedure. The discrimination task was a choice of three keys in an operant chamber. Every time the subjects reached the criterion, they were trained on a different discrimination in which one of two previously incorrect keys became the correct key. In the task with added color each key had a unique color (i.e., color discrimination). The LPO lesions disrupted the acquisition of both the spatial discrimination and the discrimination with added color. Birds with LPO damage emitted many errors in the first trial indicating the preservation of a previously correct response. Thus, the LPO lesions caused cognitive rigidity.

AVT is known to be an avian antidiuretic hormone and is released from the neurohypophysis by dehydration or hyperosmotic stimulation. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the mechanism of AVT synthesis is related to the mechanism of hormone release from the neurohypophysis. Four-day-old chicks received an AVT antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) injection into the cerebral ventricle (icv). Following antisense administration, the chicks received hypertonic saline stimulation. Plasma levels of AVT and MT were measured by radioimmunoassays. In control birds, a hypertonic saline injection resulted in the increase of plasma AVT level. The administration of a high dose (50 mug) of antisense ODN inhibited the increase of plasma AVT level induced by the hypertonic saline stimulation. Plasma levels of MT did not change with the administration of hypertonic saline or antisense ODN. These results suggest that the mechanisms that regulate the secretion of AVT from the neurohypophysis may be coupled to the mechanisms that regulate the synthesis of AVT.

However, pharmacological characterization in transfected cells shows that, even though the avian receptor is coupled to the phospholipase C, as is the AT(1), its profile of specificity towards antagonists appears different from that of the two angiotensin II mammalian receptor types. The fowl Ang II receptor mRNA is expressed in classical adult target organs for Ang II and, interestingly, also in endothelial cells, but not in vascular smooth muscle cells. In the endothelial cells, it may mediate the peculiar vasorelaxation effect of Ang II already reported in the chicken. The recent description of the expression pattern in the chick embryo shows that the avian Ang II receptor is expressed in many different mesenchymal tissues, a feature which is the signature of the AT(2) mammalian receptor. Altogether, these data imply that the avian Ang II receptor is an atypical receptor that cannot be readily classified as either of the two mammalian Ang II receptor types and, therefore, reinforce the evidence for another Ang II receptor in the avian class.

C-PSP was mainly expressed in liver and kidney and was also expressed in intestine, gizzard, glandular stomach, heart, brain and spleen though its expression was low. The expression of C-PSP in liver increased gradually from the 1st day to the 2nd week and it remained almost the same until the 13th week. C-PSP was also found in day 8 chick embryonic tissues.

Crocodilians exhibit a reproductive tract that is functionally and anatomically homologous to that found in all birds, yet their ovulatory pattern is similar to that of the other reptiles. An examination of the oviducal physiology suggests many common features shared by other vertebrates, such as oviducal prostaglandin and IGF-I synthesis. However, the crocodilian oviduct synthesizes a number of unique proteins, many of which are incorporated into the egg albumen. Oogenesis also presents attributes which mimic those found in reptiles but also shares features found only in birds. Recent evidence also has shown that crocodiles can serve as important sentinel species of ecosystem degradation. In particular, they have become a major model system for examining the endocrine disrupting effects of environmental contaminants. Current observations suggest that many populations could be impacted detrimentally by continued and expanded use of pesticides. Thus, crocodilian reproduction is influenced not only by natural variation in biotic and abiotic factors, but must also cope with the significant influence of environmental contamination.";NA;2001;"CROCODILIAN BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION";"Ecology; Developmental Biology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We also examined, through the necropsy of 80 carcasses of Grey Partridge, whether disease, parasites or poisoning could have been ultimate causes of high predation rates. The survival rate of radiotagged females during spring and summer ranged from 0.25 to 0.65 across study areas. Mortality peaked in May, June and July when females were laying and incubating. The direct negative impact of farming practices was low (6%). Predation was the main proximate cause of female mortality during breeding (73%) and determined the survival rate, suggesting no compensation by other causes of mortality. Ground carnivores were responsible for 64% of predation cases, and raptors for 29%, but this proportion varied across study sites. Disease and poisoning did not appear to favour predation, and scavenging was not likely to have substantially overestimated predation rates. The predation rate on breeding females was positively correlated with the abundance of Hen and Marsh Harriers, suggesting an additional mortality in areas where harriers were abundant. The proportion of raptor predation was linearly related to harrier abundance. The predation rate was not correlated with the abundance of the Red Fox and mustelids. A potential density-dependent effect on the predation rate was confounded by the abundance of harriers. We found no convincing relationship between the predation rate and habitat features, but we observed a positive relationship between the abundance of Hen and Marsh Harriers and the mean field size. This suggested that habitat characteristics may contribute to high predation rates through predator abundance or habitat-dependent predation.";NA;2001;"IBIS";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The number of capercaillie in Scotland has fallen since the 1970s. Previous work showed that low breeding success, exacerbated by deaths of fully grown birds flying into forest fences, was the primary cause of the decline. The hypothesis that climate change caused the lower breeding success was investigated in this study. 2, Temperature usually rose during April. There was no trend in mean April temperature during the study (1975-99) but there was a progressive cooling in mid-April relative to the rest of the month, such that the normal April warming was increasingly delayed. 3. Hens reared more chicks when the temperature rose more in early April. It is suggested that this stimulated timely plant growth, so improving the laying hens' plane of nutrition and the viability of their chicks. 4. Hens also reared more chicks when late May was warmer and early June was warmer and had fewer rain days. Young chicks may have foraged more successfully in warm dry conditions. However, neither temperature nor rain days in late May or early June showed any trend during the study. 5.

We studied the dynamics, reversibility and repeatability of organ size changes using noninvasive imaging techniques. We employed light and electron microscopy, flow cytometry and immunohistology to study the cytological mechanisms that drive the size changes of the small intestine. Within 2 days of feeding, the size of the small intestine increased to up to three times the fasting value. The size changes were fully reversible and could be elicited repeatedly by feeding. These enormous size changes were possible because the mucosal epithelium of the small intestine is a transitional epithelium that allows for considerable size changes without cell proliferation. Histological evidence suggested that a fluid pressure-pump system (lymphatic, blood pressure) was the driving force that inflated the intestinal villi. The rates of cell proliferation were not elevated immediately after feeding but peaked 1 week later when small intestine size was already declining. In contrast to the current paradigm, we suggest that the small intestine is not part of the previously proposed 'pay-before-pumping' model. Instead, the size of the python's small intestine may be upregulated without major metabolic investment. It can occur even if the individual is energetically exhausted. An evolutionary perspective of the transitional epithelium mechanism suggests superior functionality compared with the pay-before-pumping model because it allows for long periods of fasting and depletion of energy reserves, while still enabling the snake to digest prey and absorb nutrients.";"phenotypic flexibility; gastrointestinal tract; nutrition; functional anatomy; Burmese python; Python molurus bivittatus";2001;"JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY";"Biology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

It was shown that polyploidization of quail cardiomyocytes occurs during the first 40 days after hatching and ends by the time growth is completed. In adult birds, the cardiomyocyte ploidy hardly changed at all. Interspecies comparison revealed that in the adult bird myocardium 2cx2 myocytes are predominant, accounting for at least 50% of the cell population. Multinuclear cells with three to eight diploid nuclei were widespread. The percentage of such cells was five to six times higher in precocial species than in altricial birds of the same weight. Myocytes with polyploid nuclei were rare. A significant interspecies variability of cardiomyocyte ploidy levels was observed. The most prominent differences were found between the precocial and the altricial birds. The mean number of genomes in cells correlated both with the body mass and with the growth rate of the birds. The differences between the precocial and altricial birds disappeared when a statistical method was used to eliminate the effect of the growth rate, but did not when the effect of body mass was eliminated. Among the altricial birds, which are generally immobile during growth, the cardiomyocyte ploidy levels also con elated more closely with growth rate than with body mass. The opposite was observed in the precocial birds, which are highly mobile from the first minutes of life. We conclude that the interspecies variability of bird cardiomyocyte ploidy levels is a result of changes in the balance between the cardiac functional load and the growth rate; this is manifested at the cellular level as a competition between the proliferation and differentiation of cardiomyocytes.

There was no relationship (P greater than or equal to 0.437) between changes in quail abundance and the PMDI or raw precipitation in the Gulf Prairies and Marshes physiographic region, where precipitation was relatively high. The monthly PMDI was a better indicator of changes in both northern bobwhite and Scaled Quail abundance among years than was monthly precipitation alone. Both monthly and 12-month precipitation-based weather indices were more correlated with changes in Northern Bobwhite and scaled quail abundance among years in relatively dry as opposed to wet ecological regions.

The braincases of the tetrapod-like fishes Panderichthys and Eusthenopteron are structurally very similar, while that of the stem tetrapod Acanthostega was characteristically tetrapod-like in construction of the otic region and hyomandibula. In contrast to this, the occipital region is conservative and Eusthenopteron-like in Acanthostega, with no occipital condyle. Eusthenopteron, Panderichthys, Acanthostega and the stem tetrapod Greererpeton are successively more crownward plesions used to represent the fish-tetrapod transition. The embryonic otoccipital region originates from cephalic mesoderm, somitic mesoderm and neural crest. At the fish-tetrapod transition, these embryonic components appear subject to different rates of change. The representative animals retain as adults conspicuous landmarks of the embryonic braincase, the ventral cranial and metotic fissues, which appear to represent the boundaries between the main embryogenic tissues, so that the domains of some of these tissues may be identified. The evolution of an occipital condyle proper is a late event in tetrapod evolution. In birds, the occipital condyle is formed from a somite additional to those which comprise the basioccipital proper. This could reflect the late evolution of the occipital condyle and axial regionalisation in tetrapod history. Two features especially distinguish the otocciptial regions of fish and stem tetrapods. In tetrapods, the hyomandibula or stapes fits into the fenestra vestibuli, a hole between cephalic mesoderm and somitic mesoderm components. The lateral commissure, which carries the hyomandibular facets in fishes, disappears. Secondly, the ventral cranial fissure is closed in tetrapods as the basisphenoid meets the basioccipital and the parasphenoid underlies the complex. The fenestra vestibuli falls at the junction of three of the tissue domains. The ethmoid and basisphenoid components of the braincase, the dermal parasphenoid and the stapes (hyoid arch), are all of neural crest origin. These components undergo rapid changes in braincase structure at the fish-tetrapod transition. This event may be characterized by a rapid increase in the neural crest components of the braincase.";NA;2001;"MAJOR EVENTS IN EARLY VERTEBRATE EVOLUTION: PALAEONTOLOGY, PHYLOGENY, GENETICS AND DEVELOPMENT";"Biology; Paleontology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

T gaudichaudii occurred in high densities (up to 61 individuals m(-3)) in the water column, being more abundant within islands in the western part of the gulf than at open gulf and shelf stations. The amphipod was a major prey of all seabird species investigated except the South Georgian diving petrel, accounting for 39, 80, 68, 59 and 46% of the total number of prey of blue petrels, thin-billed prions, Antarctic prions, common diving petrels and southern rockhopper penguins, respectively. The length-frequency distribution of T gaudichaudii was similar between the 2 diving species, which fed on 1 large size class of adult individuals, whereas the 3 surface-feeding seabirds preyed upon 2 size classes but in different proportions. Juveniles and adults T gaudichaudii were equally important in the diet of blue petrels, whereas juveniles and adults predominated in the food of thin-billed and Antarctic prions, respectively. Comparison of T gaudichaudii found in nets and food samples together with observations at sea indicated that common diving petrels and southern rockhopper penguins fed in the close vicinity of the colonies in the Golfe du Morbihan, whereas blue petrels, and thin-billed and Antarctic prions mainly preyed upon amphipods outside the sampled area. Our study shows that T.gaudichaudii an important local component of the macrozooplankton community and the main prey for planktivorous seabirds inhabiting the Kerguelen archipelago.

Previous studies using pharmacobehavioral methods to implicate protein phosphatase activity in memory formation have been unable to discriminate between protein phosphatases 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A), as available cell-permeable agents generally inhibit both enzyme classes. To address this difficulty the present study exploited differences in the potency of the selective phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, toward PP1 and PP2A. Within the context of a temporally precise animal model of memory, developed using the day-old chick (Gallus domesticus), acute administration of various concentrations of okadaic acid was found to disrupt two temporally distinct stages of memory formation. When administered bilaterally into an area of the chick brain implicated in memory formation, concentrations of okadaic acid known to selectively inhibit PP2A in vitro disrupted memory from 50 min posttraining. Higher concentrations, reported to inhibit both PP2A and PP1 in vitro, produced significant retention deficits from 20 min posttraining. Identical temporally specific effects were also obtained by varying the concentration and time of administration of calyculin A, a phosphatase inhibitor with equal potency toward both enzyme classes.

In each line, three groups were created; one group in which the chicks were fed ad lib. and two other groups in which the chicks received 70% and 40% of the line-specific ad lib. feeding levels, respectively. In all three groups, chick survival rates were very high, and no relationship was detected between feeding level and chick mortality. The experimental feeding levels strongly affected the chicks' attainment of body mass at all ages. In addition, at most ages the growth of the structural components (wing, tarsus, and head) were also significantly affected by the feeding experiment but to a much smaller extent than the body mass. The feeding levels also affected the achievement of female sexual maturity such that, at the end of the experiment, most of the ad lib.-fed females and none of the females that received 40% of the ad lib. feeding level were laying eggs. In chicks of both lines that were fed ad lib., homeothermy was achieved at 7 d of age, but in chicks that received 40% of the line-specific ad lib. levels, homeothermy was achieved after 15-22 d of age. Poikilothermic chicks (P- and C-line) that were relatively heavy for their age exhibited relatively high resting metabolic rates (RMRs) and peak metabolic rates (PMRs) for their age. In addition, a positive relationship was found between the chicks' relative mass and RMR (based on mass-based predictive equations). No relationship was detected between the chicks' relative body mass and their relative PMR (relative to mass-based predictive equations). With respect to the metabolic scope (i.e., PMR - RMR), Japanese quail chicks exhibited remarkable developmental plasticity: chicks with body masses that were 50% lower than the normal growing chicks did exhibit a normal capacity of thermogenic heat production for their mass. Because no differences were found with respect to the level of plasticity of morphological and physiological development between the two strains, we conclude that the selection for high postnatal growth rates in P-strain chicks has not resulted in a in a higher vulnerability of these chicks to food restrictions.";NA;2001;"PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY";"Physiology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

In this study, the anatomical and histological effects of in ovo exposure to the synthetic oestrogen ethynyloestradiol on the oviducts of immature and adult female Japanese quail, Coturnix japonica, were investigated. A series of abnormalities was observed after injection of ethyloestradiol (2 or 20 ng g(-1) egg) into the yolk on day 3 of incubation. Ethynyloestradiol induced precocious differentiation of the luminal epithelium and tubular glands in immature chicks. Right-side oviduct retention occurred at all the ages studied, whereas certain other effects were not evident until sexual maturity. The left oviduct was reduced in size and tubular grand density in the uterus (shell gland) was reduced in sexually mature birds that had been treated with ethynyloestradiol. The utero-vaginal junction was longer than in control birds and had a higher tubular gland density. The epithelial cells in the magnum were taller in birds treated with ethynyloestradiol.

Basic parameters on birds and their habitats obtained from 150 points counts carried out by means of Frequential Sampling (EFP) have been submitted to a Correspondence Analysis with respect to Instrumental Variables (AFC-VI). The results of this Multivariate Analysis allow us to define 6 groups of species representative of the various sampled formations and to characterize the habitat they occupy within the studied gradient of vegetation structure which stretches from open grassland to forest. The composition of the breeding avifauna of the three most important formations, i.e. grassland (16 species), shrubland (32 species), and pine forest (31 species) is drawn up and their patrimonial value analysed using the criteria retained by Rocamora & Yeatman-Berthelot (1999). This analysis reveals that grasslands with 14 patrimonial species and shrublands with 18 species have a stronger patrimonial interest than pine forest (only one species). A comparison of the current and past composition of the Causse Mejean's bird communities is carried out thanks to both published and unpublished previous data.

In preparation for a study of the behaviour of free-ranging Australian brush-turkey (Alectura lathami) chicks, we investigated methods of transmitter attachment and assessed possible effects on the behaviour and condition of captive hatchlings. We attached transmitters to 2-10-day-old chicks by gluing the tag to the skin on the back with eyelash-glue. Rapid-setting glues (such as Superglue), often used for gluing transmitters to other birds, were found to damage the skin and were not used. Retention of transmitters was 3-4 weeks. We detected no difference in the time spent preening, feeding, resting and moving between captive radio-tagged chicks and a control group. Flight of tagged chicks was not hindered by the radio-package and tagged chicks gained mass at the same rate as the control group. Free-ranging chicks with radio-tags showed no obvious signs of a negative effect of the transmitters on behaviour: they flew without obvious impediment, walked more than 100 m per day and, except for a single chick, did not become entangled in vegetation.

In 1998 we placed our group of 3.3 L. bulweri together in a complex outdoor habitat, in order to investigate several questions. These included whether monogamous pairing was the natural mating system for the species, how the new grouping would affect their behavior, and what microhabitats the individuals preferred within the complex habitat. Initially. all six individuals remained in the same enclosure without conflict. After a period of approximately 6 weeks, 2.1 of these individuals were removed for their safety, due to increasingly aggressive interactions. The data we collected indicate that the species may have an exploded lek type of mating system in the wild and that individuals may flock together in the nonbreeding season. In addition, males and females seem to prefer different types of shade regimes. These results suggest ways to improve husbandry and breeding success of the species in captivity.

Seasonal abundance (assessed as the number of birds flushed per unit effort), sex ratios and reproductive condition (based on gonad sizes) of the quail were measured over a period of 16 months, including two hunting seasons. Hunting impacts were assessed in terms of the number of birds killed per unit of hunting effort. Quail exhibited a spring peak in abundance and reproduction, which coincided with the legal hunting season, and bird numbers varied markedly between years. Sex ratio varied, with males dominating early in spring, Hunters killed nearly 60% of the birds flushed, and hunter efficiency was positively correlated with the abundance of quail. These results confirm the dilemma for managers, as quail are currently hunted during the main breeding season and offtakes are high. The development of management strategies is hampered by a lack of understanding of the population biology and ecology, and impacts of hunting. A number of possible hunting strategies are discussed.

During the breeding season courtship song occurs prior to copulation and appears to reflect male sexual arousal. Outside the breeding season starlings sing, but song appears unrelated to reproduction. The aromatization of testosterone mt likely within the medial preoptic nucleus (POM), is critical for the expression of male sexual arousal. The present study was performed to determine whether seasonal changes in the POM might relate to seasonal changes in courtship singing behavior in male starlings. T concentrations, the volume of the POM, and aromatase within the POM were examined both during and outside of the breeding season in male starlings. Song was also recorded at these times both with and without a female present. The POM was largest and contained dense aromatase immunostaining only during the spring breeding season, when T concentrations were highest and males responded to a female with an increase in courtship song. Outside the breeding season the volume of the POM was small, T concentrations were low, and males displayed no changes in song expression in response to female conspecifics. Song bout length was positively related to POM volume, and males sang longer songs in spring. Only males with nestboxes in spring responded to a female, and the POM tended to be larger in these males, suggesting that nestbox possession might influence neuroplasticity within the POM. Overall, the findings suggest that T-dependent plasticity and aromatase activity within the POM might regulate courtship singing in a wild songbird.

In this paper, we examine patterns of growth and inquire about evolutionary processes that led to different degrees of precocity at hatching in Galliformes. The postnatal development of body mass and that of seven morphometric parameters of wing and leg of Brush Turkey Alectura lathami, Peacock Pavo cristatus, Pheasant Phasianus colchicus and Japanese Quail Coturnix japonica was characterized by the ratio of exponential growth rate (EGR) to relative size (ln(W/A); W = size at a given age; A = asymptote) at a given age. From that relationship, we derived developmental trajectories as the slopes of a least squares regression of EGR on relative size. The slopes of the developmental trajectories are indicative of the degree of precocity of development. We found that Brush Turkey, Peacock, and Pheasant follow the same developmental trajectory. However, the Brush Turkey hatches heterochronically delayed on that trajectory and consequently, its hatchlings are superprecocial. The Quail follows a significantly steeper developmental trajectory and hatches with a high degree of embryonic function (EGR). From a comparative phylogenetic analysis we reconstruct the ancestral galliform developmental trajectory and infer that hypermorphosis of Brush Turkey embryos led to the superprecocial hatchlings. The steeper developmental trajectory of Quail is evolutionary derived from ancestral patterns of growth by somatic paedomorphosis. Using a multivariate approach we show that development of different parts of the body is coherent, i.e., that patterns of development of wing and leg do not vary independently of each other. Consequently, selection for changed development of any part of the wing or the leg will cause the other parts to change too.";NA;2000;"JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Hunting statistics or count data were collected as total number of individuals shot or counted each year from five provinces. For the province of Trento data were available at the level of mountain groups and a more detailed investigation was carried out. The results from Trento were compared with the more general findings from the other four Italian provinces. Time series analysis was performed to investigate the pattern of cycle and autoregressive models were used to describe the density dependence structure. In general, the populations showed a weak or no tendency to regular fluctuations: rock ptarmigan Lagopus mutus and black grouse Tetrao tetrix populations exhibited the highest tendency to cycle with periods of 5-9 years while capercaillie Tetrao urogallus never showed regular fluctuations. Hazel grouse Bonasa bonasia cyclic dynamics were restricted to a few populations of Trento. When time series from Trento were corrected for hunting effort the detection of cycle among populations sharply increased but no differences in the strength of second order density dependence or in the period length was observed. A linear first order autoregressive model explained better the intrinsic structure of the majority of populations.

Model parameters were largely based on the results of a field study in the Bavarian Alps. Environmental fluctuations (amount of rainfall in June and July) are taken into account in the early survival of chicks. For the default parameter set, the model predicts a minimum capacity needed for viability, i.e. for the extinction risk not to exceed 1% in 100 years, of about 470 individuals. In the Bavarian Alps, this corresponds to area requirements of an isolated viable population in an order of magnitude of 250 km(2). These results are, however, sensitive to small changes in model parameters such as female survival, clutch survival and chick survival. We conclude that minimum viable population size and minimum area requirements may vary considerably across the range of the capercaillie. Therefore, we plan to apply our model to different parameter sets from different regions in order to explore the range of conditions under which capercaillie populations may be viable.";"capacity; capercaillie; environmental noise; extinction; minimum viable population; model; sensitivity";2000;"WILDLIFE BIOLOGY";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

One approach is to study the behaviour that drives the formation of new leks today. Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain the formation of leks, and they can roughly be divided into two groups; one which advocates that the males are the driving force and one which argues that the females are the driving force. In this study we use data from a long-term study (1979-1998) of a capercaillie population at Varaldskogen in southeast Norway to develop a model describing how new leks are formed in this species. By using data on spacing pattern and behaviour of radio-marked young and adult birds of both sexes we demonstrate how the situation develops from winter towards mating in spring. Furthermore, we report on a few cases of new leks that have arisen in the area during the 20 years of study. We argue that both female mate choice, male territoriality and male attraction to locations with high densities of females are involved in a dynamic process of lek formation. We present results which indicate that new leks are mainly founded by young birds. Finally, we shaw that when new leks are formed the spacing patterns of the individuals involved change.

Although there is increasing knowledge of the influence of landscape elements on reproduction, specifically nesting success, wildlife scientists currently suffer from a paucity of data regarding landscape features that increase risk of mortality. We examined spatial attributes of 80 wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) mortality sites in Arkansas from 1993 to 1998 to determine landscape elements associated with mortality. We hypothesized that turkeys would be killed more often by predators in small parches, stream valleys, and other areas promoting predator use. We also suspected that habitat features differed between predation sites and where turkeys were harvested. With a geographic information system, we determined, for each kill site, cover-type, patch size and shape, measures of habitat diversity and interspersion, distances to United States Forest Service (USFS) roads and streams, terrain features (slope, elevation, aspect), and whether the kill occurred in edge or core habitat. We found that 59% of variation in mortality location could be explained by landscape characteristics. Predation occurred randomly across cover types, but more often in larger patches than were generally available in the study area. After excluding great horned owl (Bubo virginianus) predation, kill sites were located more frequently in stream valleys. Bobcat(Lynx rufus) and canid kills were segregated spatially in the landscape, with bobcat kills southwest of canid kills; 7 of 8 canid kills occurred in edge habitat, whereas bobcat kills were distributed equally in edge and core habitat. Harvest occurred in larger, more diverse patches situated on ridge tops and farther from well-traveled roads than did predation. These areas may provide refuge from predation when turkeys are not hunted, When possible, increased closings of logging roads and trails to vehicular traffic is recommended because it appears that poachers used these paths to access turkey habitat away from well-traveled roads. Also, we suggest that increased penalties, reward programs, and education may aid in reducing losses due to poaching.";"Arkansas; habitat; Meleagris gallopavo; mortality; patch size; poaching; refugia; wild turkey";2000;"WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN";"Biodiversity Conservation";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Warren, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, personal communication). Sage grouse populations are allied closely with sagebrush (Artemisia spp.).

Chemical and mechanical treatments intended to provide increased quantities of grass forage for livestock have indirectly reduced the acceptability of sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) rangelands for sage grouse. Our paper examines: 1) potential mechanisms whereby livestock grazing in big sagebrush (A, tridentata) communities can modify sage grouse habitat and 2) the indirect influences of livestock production on sage grouse habitat. Overall, livestock grazing appears to most affect productivity of sage grouse populations. Residual grass cover following grazing is essential to conceal sage grouse nests from predators. Future research needs are identified and management implications related to livestock grazing in sage grouse habitats are included.";"Artemisia tridentata; Centrocercus urophasianus; livestock grazing; sagebrush habitat; sage grouse";2000;"WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN";"Biodiversity Conservation";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We conducted a reward-band study to estimate harvest, reporting, and survival rates of pheasants raised and released by the Pennsylvania Game Commission (PGC) for the fall 1998 hunting season. We banded 6,770 of 199,613 released pheasants with leg bands worth $0-$400. Rewards > $75 produced 100% reporting rates. Hunters reported 71.0% of harvested pheasants banded with standard bands (no reward). Cocks had an estimated 62.3% harvest rate when released on public land and a 46.8% harvest rate on private land. Hens had an estimated 50.4% harvest rate when released on public land and a 31.1% harvest rate on private land. Estimated harvest rate for hen pheasants released in September in the either-sex zone was 15.5%. In the late season, pheasants released on public land had a 33.6% harvest rate and a 23.5% harvest rate on private land. We found that few pheasants (<6%) survived > 30 days and birds released on public land had reduced survival rates primarily because of greater harvest rates. In fiscal year 1998-99, the net cost to raise and release 199,613 pheasants was $2,813,138 ($14.09 per bird). The average cost per harvested pheasant was $29.10, but ranged from $22.63 to $90.74 depending on the date and location of release. We estimated that 49.9% (82,017 birds) of pheasants stocked immediately prior to and during the regular and late seasons (excluding September releases of hens) were harvested by hunters. Percentage of pheasants harvested by hunters could be increased by expanding the either-sex zone in Pennsylvania so that more hens could be legally killed by hunters and by allocating releases to seasons and locations with greater harvest rates. However, before such changes are implemented, we recommend a survey of Pennsylvania pheasant hunters to ascertain their opinions and desires regarding releases of game-farm pheasants.";"band; harvest rate; Pennsylvania; Phasianus colchicus; reporting rate; reward; ring-necked pheasant; survival";2000;"WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN";"Biodiversity Conservation";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

In this paper, I synthesize the results obtained from a series of studies dealing with the structure and composition of wintering and breeding bird communities and the impacts of predation and brood parasitism on avian nesting success over a 22-year period (1974-1995) on a study area affected by even-aged management in central Pennsylvania. Fourteen wintering species were noted on the study area; 8 (57%) were present on treated (managed) and reference (uncut) sectors. Species richness of wintering birds remained relatively constant over time, but trunk-bark foraging species, e.g., black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus), predominated on the study area. Forty-seven breeding species were recorded on the study area; 37 (79%) occupied both sectors. Unlike in winter, species richness fluctuated widely over time, perhaps due to chance or short-term response to habitat changes created by even-aged management. Early successional species, e.g., eastern towhee (Pipilio erythrophthalmus), tended to be most common on the study area; however, as plant succession progressed, forest-interior species, e.g., ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), became abundant. Nest predation declined over time, in pan because of probable reductions in abundance of avian nest predators. Incidences of brood parasitism remained relatively low throughout the study period. A comprehensive, long-term study on a localized area, such as this study in central Pennsylvania, provides important insight into the effects of small-scale, even-aged management on bird communities in a managed forested landscape.";"bird community; clearcutting; even-aged management; forest; nest predation; nesting success; Pennsylvania";2000;"WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN";"Biodiversity Conservation";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Neither the training condition (MeA, 1/3MeA, or water) nor the responses at test (recall or amnesia) significantly contributed to the immunopositive cell densities in all of these regions. On the other hand, single intraperitoneal injection of metrazole (CNS convulsant) induced a transient epileptiform seizure, and caused significantly enhanced ZENK expression in HV and LPO but not in HA and N. However, the metrazol-induced seizure did not interfere with the following passive avoidance training, and chicks successfully learned to avoid the aversive bead when tested at 24 hr subsequently. Among three groups of chicks (metrazol-treated, saline control, and untreated chicks), no significant differences were found in their responses at test (recall, generalized avoidance, or amnesia).

For reproducibility and equivalent precision of analysis, successive portions of the medulla-called pseudorhombomeres ""r7"" to ""r11""-were delimited by transverse planes through the center of adjacent somites at stages HH10/ 11. These units were each grafted homotopically and isochronically from quail donors into chick hosts. The chimeric specimens were fixed at stages HH35/36 and alternate Nissl-stained sagittal sections were compared to adjacent sections in which quail cells were detected immunocytochemically. This analysis in general showed that there is little intermixing between adjacent pseudorhombomeric domains, although some neuronal populations in the vestibular and trigeminal columns, as well as in the reticular formation and pontine nuclei, do migrate selectively into the host hindbrain. Contralateral migration was scarce up to the stages examined. Several motor nuclei, i.e., the vagal motor complex, or sensory nuclei, i.e., the medial vestibular nucleus, show cytoarchitectonic limits that coincide with pseudorhombomeric ones; however, most conventional grisea were found to originate across several pseudorhombomeres. The inferior olivary complex originated between ""r8"" and ""r11"" (between the centers of somites 1 and 5). The medullospinal boundary coincided precisely with the center of the fifth somite, slightly caudal to the obex and the end of the choroidal roof, and correlated with the end of many medullary cytoarchitectonic units. In contrast, the dorsal column nuclei and the caudal subnucleus of the descending trigeminal column fell within the spinal cord. On the whole, the patterns observed were very similar to those found before within the overtly segmented part of the hindbrain, suggesting that some underlying common mechanism may account for the transverse cytoarchitectonic boundaries.

If T enhances opportunities for reproductive success, as suggested by previous experiments, why does elevated T not occur naturally? To address this question, we prolonged the early peak level throughout the breeding season and explored potential energetic costs of maintaining elevated T. We measured daily energy expenditure (DEE) of treated males (T-males) and controls (C-males) using doubly labelled water (DLW). We also conducted behaviour scans of T- and C-males housed in outdoor aviaries. DEE was not higher in T-males than in C-males. However, T-males did increase locomotion and foraging and decrease rest and self-maintenance. These results suggest that elevated T may increase the contribution of some components of DEE and lower the contribution of others. Furthermore, the T-induced decrease in allocation of time to rest and maintenance may represent a long-term cost that has led to selection against the maintenance of elevated T beyond the natural early spring peak.

We investigated costs during incubation by experimentally enlarging 25 clutches of white-tailed ptarmigan Lagopus leucurus. The experiment was conducted in 2 years, one with harsh weather that forced a natural delay in reproduction. When forced to delay egg-laying, females began incubation with poorer bed; condition and foraged more during incubation. Rates of mass loss during incubation were not affected by clutch enlargement, and did not differ between harsh and benign years; however, females that were heavier at the start of incubation lost more mass than lighter females. Clutch-enlarged females had reduced nest attendance compared to control birds in both years and incubation periods increased by up to 2 days relative to controls. In the harsh year, there was a trend for clutch-enlarged females to have lower nest success, but there was no effect on overwinter survival. Different behavioral responses by females in the 2 years showed that incubation costs may depend on other factors such as female quality, food supply, or weather conditions.

Exposure assessment for endocrine disrupters should direct specific tests for wildlife species, placing hazard data into a risk assessment context. Supplementing the suite of mammalian screens now under Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) validation, high priority should be given to developing a fish screening assay for detecting endocrine activity in oviparous species. Taking into account both exposure characterization and alerts from endocrine screening, higher tier tests are also a priority for defining adverse effects. We propose that in vivo mammalian and fish assays provide a comprehensive screening battery for diverse hormonal functions (including androgen, estrogen, and thyroid hormone), whereas Amphibia should be considered at higher tiers if there are exposure concerns. Higher tier endocrine-disrupter resting should include fish development and fish reproduction tests, whereas a full life-cycle test could be subsequently used to refine aquatic risk assessments when necessary. For avian risk assessment, the new OECD Japanese quail reproduction test guideline provides a valuable basis for developing a test to detecting endocrine-mediated reproductive effects; this species could be used, where necessary, for an avian life-cycle test. For aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, data from existing developmental and reproductive tests remain of high value for ecological risk assessment.

To examine whether the selective pecking is based on the ability to memorize shapes, we analyzed pecking behavior of 1- to 2-days-old quail chicks (Coturnix japonica) by using ball- and triangle-shaped beads both painted in green. Repeated presentation of dry bead (either ball or triangle) resulted in a progressively fewer number of pecks (habituation). When chicks were tested by triangle after repeated presentation of ball, chicks showed a significant increase in the number of pecks at the triangle (dishabituation). On the other hand, when tested by ball after a series of triangle presentations, pecking frequency did not increase (nb dishabituation). Chicks thus distinguished the triangle as a novel object after being habituated to ball, but did not respond to the ball after triangle. A similar asymmetry was found in one-trial passive avoidance task. Chicks were pre-trained by water-coated (neutral) triangle and then trained by methylanthranilate-coated (aversive) ball. In this case, most chicks learned to avoid the ball, and half of these successful learners pecked at the triangle; they distinguished triangle from ball. When chicks were pre-trained by neutral ball and trained by aversive triangle, on the other hand, most chicks did not distinguish the ball from triangle, and showed a generalized avoidance for both beads.

In this study, we examined whether chicks memorize objects by colors, and how they exploit the memorized color cues for selective pecking in 1- to 2-days-old quail chicks (Coturnix japonica). Ball-shaped beads painted in green (G), yellowish green (YG) and the intermediate color (YGG) were used. Repetitive presentation of a bead (interval: 4.5 min) resulted in gradually fewer pecks (habituation). Subsequent presentation of a different color caused proportionately more pecks (dishabituation); e.g., after habituation to the G bead, the YG bead caused a stronger dishabituation than the YGG bead did. The dishabituation appeared symmetric; e.g., the YG bead caused as strong dishabituation after the G-habituation, as was caused by the G bead after the YG-habituation. Number of pecks could thus reveal the memory-based color perception in chicks. Similar discrimination of beads by memorized color cues was found after one-trial passive avoidance training, where chicks learned to avoid a bitter-tasting object without any differential pre-training experiences. However, proportion of the chicks that discriminated between different colors became progressively smaller at test 15 min, 1 hr, and 24 hr post-training.

Enrichment devices would intuitively be more effective if they reliably attracted and sustained appreciable interest but many fail to do so. This may reflect the fact that the choice of stimuli often reflects availability and human preconceptions rather than a critical consideration of the birds' preferences and pre-dispositions. We had previously identified string as a particularly attractive pecking stimulus for chicks and adult hens (Gallus gallus domesticus) of a laying strain (ISA Brown). In the present study we found that chicks of another laying strain (Lohmann Brown) also pecked sooner and more at a bunch of string than at chains or beads (Experiment 1). White or yellow strings were preferred to led, green or blue ones (Experiment 2) and white string elicited more pecking than did combinations of white and yellow or of all five colours (Experiment 3). Varying the length and width of the bunches of string exerted no detectable effects on pecking (Experiment 4) whereas incorporating small, shiny beads in the white string devices actually reduced pecking (Experiment 5). Virtually all the devices elicited progressively more interest with repeated presentation; this trend was particularly marked for white string. Collectively, the present findings demonstrate that young domestic chicks have clear and specific pecking preferences. Although the magnitude of response varied across experiments, white string consistently elicited the most interest. Our two main conclusions are: (i) white or yellow strings were particularly attractive stimuli that drew increasing interest, at least in the short term, and (ii) simple devices were preferred to more complex ones, or at least to those used hen.

A cohort of unspecified mesodermal cells differentiates into primitive endothelial cells, which migrate to and occupy positions within the stereotypical blueprint of the primitive vasculature, Once in position, these cells coalesce and form cords, which lumenize and become ensheathed by supporting pericytes and smooth muscle cells. This primitive vascular network is extensively remodeled in some places, and expanded by sprouting in others. Various studies using the mouse, quail/chick, and frog have uncovered a number of signals that guide these complex processes but many gaps still exist in our understanding of the mechanisms by which the embryonic vasculature is built. Because many questions will require in vivo studies to be properly addressed, the zebrafish, with its unique accessibility to analysis by combined embryological, molecular, and genetic methods, should prove invaluable in identifying new molecules involved in blood vessel development and integrating pathways that influence embryonic blood vessel formation.

Sperm viability was assessed with the live/dead stain (SYBR-14/propidium iodine). Sperm viability at osmolalities greater than or equal to 800 mOsm was higher (P < 0.05) in raptor than poultry semen. Return to isotonicity after exposure to hypertonicity (3000 mOsm) decreased (P < 0.05) number of viable spermatozoa in chicken, turkey, and golden and Bonelli's eagle spermatozoa but not in imperial eagle or peregrine falcon spermatozoa. Differences were found in spermatozoa resistance to hypotonic conditions, with eagle species demonstrating the most tolerance.

Rapid cooling was detrimental (P < 0.05) to spermatozoa from all species except the imperial eagle and the chicken.

End products of in vitro cecal fermentation (SCFA, ammonia and gases) were measured to judge how well an animal protein diet could be fermented. The animal protein diet resulted in the less intensive fermentation with increased feed intake and volume of cecal contents than the plant protein diet only in guinea pigs. This may be due to a limited capacity of the hindgut microflora to adapt to the substrate rich in animal protein.

Litter size varied from four to 14 in blue foxes and from three to eight in silver foxes. Silver fox cubs had higher birth weights than blue foxes. Inter-species body weights and growth rates were apparently dependent on litter size and the dam's constitution. In both species growth rate increased with age and body weight (7-35 g per day). In the cubs, the biological half-life of body water turnover (BWT) rose from 1.5 days at 2-3 days of age to 2.5 days at 13-16 days of age, although a considerable scatter was seen. The mean daily milk intake of the cubs varied with body weight, from 31 to 193 g per day, whereas daily milk intake per unit of body mass remained stable at 30-35 g per 100 g body weight. The ratio of milk intake to body weight gain varied considerably among cubs, averaging 4.5 g/g during the 3-week experimental period. In suckling fox cubs, the calculated daily intake of metabolically energy (ME) corresponded fairly with the estimated energy requirements for growth and maintenance of the young. Finally, the applicability and the accuracy of the WID technique was evaluated in ten 3-week-old fox cubs, by tube-feeding with a milk replacer for 48 h, which documented that the daily rates of milk intake and water turnover can be accurately measured in suckling fox cubs by the WID technique following a single injection of (HHO)-H-3.

Kit fox abundance varied widely during this period and population estimates on a 216-km(2) study area ranged from 46 (0.21/km(2)) in 1991 to 363 (1.68/km(2)) in 1994. The finite rate of increase (lambda) ranged from 0.37 in 1995 to 2.22 in 1993. Of 341 adult and 184 juvenile foxes radiocollared, we recovered 225 and 142 dead, respectively. Mean annual survival rate for adults was 0.44 (range = 0.20-0.81) and the mean rate for juveniles from 1 May to 15 February (age 1) was 0.14 (range = <0.01-0.31). Coyotes (Canis latrans) and other predators were the primary source of mortality for adult and juvenile foxes, and vehicles were a secondary source. Mean annual reproductive success (proportion of females observed with pups in Apr-May) was 61% (range = 20-100%) for adults and 18% (range = 0-100%) for juveniles. Mean annual litter size was 3.8 and varied from 2.0 to 4.8. Population growth rates varied positively with reproductive success (P = 0.041), and both juvenile reproductive success and the proportion of new individuals were higher (P = 0.001 and P = 0.100) when the fox population was increasing. Leporids and kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spp.) were important foods for kit foxes, and annual use of foods by kit foxes varied markedly during the study Kit fox density was positively related to both current and previous year's composite prey indices (P = 0.001 and P = 0.067). Finite growth rates were positively related to rodent indices (P = 0.085) and current year's composite prey indices (P = 0.084). Rodent abundance and composite prey indices were strongly related to previous year's effective (Oct-Mar) precipitation (P = 0.002 and P = 0.003), as were kit fox density (P = 0.021) and <lambda> estimates (P = 0.002). A step-wise multiple regression model that included precipitation totals from the previous 3 years as independent variables explained 79% (P < 0.001) of the annual variation in fox abundance. Survival of adult kit foxes was negatively related to abundance of both coyotes (P = 0.046) and leporids (the primary prey of coyotes; P = 0.031). However, fox and coyote abundance generally tracked each other and neither kit fox abundance nor survival increased during a coyote control program conducted during 1985-90. We did not find strong evidence that oilfield activities were impacting kit foxes at NPRC. Fox abundance was significantly lower in oil-developed areas than in undeveloped areas during 6 of 13 years (P < 0.006). However, population trends of foxes appeared to be affected more by natural factors (e.g., food availability, competitor abundance) than oilfield activities. Kit fox population trends on NPRC appeared to be driven by precipitation-mediated prey abundance. Variation in prey availability, particularly kangaroo rats, produced significant and sometimes rapid changes in kit fox demographics and abundance. Kit fox abundance in the southern San Joaquin Valley is highly dynamic, warranting (1) conservation of sufficient habitat to maintain viable populations of foxes through population lows, and (2) research on management strategies to optimize habitat quality, particularly prey abundance.";"California; demography; endangered species; environmental variation; food habits; Naval Petroleum Reserves in California; oilfield effects; population dynamics; population monitoring; San Joaquin kit fox; San Joaquin Valley; Vulpes macrotis mutica";2000;"WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Often, the probability of the extinction of a population in certain time horizon is assessed. Risk analyses are based on a stochastic model of population dynamics. The assumptions about the population model and the values of parameters are crucial in risk analysis: small changes in model assumptions or parameter values can lead to markedly different results. Thus, the results of risk analysis should be interpreted very carefully. However, even if the results are uncertain, they can provide useful insight for the population dynamics and also reveal the possible gaps in the knowledge of species ecology. In this paper, the future of capercaillie in different regions in Finland was assessed with risk analysis. The risk analysis was carried out using Bayesian population dynamics modeling. In the analyses, Finnish wildlife triangle census data (1989-1997) were utilized and annual density, breeding success and adult sex ratio were computed for each study region from the data. Because the annual mortality rates cannot be directly measured from the wildlife triangle data, the analysis was performed with two different assumptions of the mortality rates for adult and juvenile birds: (1) the mortality rates are density dependent; and (2) mortality rates are not related to density. The results of risk analysis with these two assumptions differed considerably. If the mortality is strictly density dependent, the future of capercaillie seems secure, whereas in other case the future seems quite difficult. To be able to produce more reliable estimates about the future of capercaillie in Finland more detailed information about regional and annual variation in mortality rates as well as the pattern of density dependence of mortality rates are needed.

At 15 days of age pecking session, M (mash) was recorded when chicks ate a mash diet. Pecking session C (change) at 16 or 17 days of age was recorded immediately after the change of the diet to pellets presented either as regular cylinders (P) to eight chicks, or as semiovoid (Po) to eight other chicks. Pecking session A (adapted) was recorded 5 or 6 days after adaptation to P and Po. Successful (consumatory) pecks were 72%, 52%, and 61% of all pecks for sessions M, C, and A, respectively. The head of the chicks remained in a steady position between two consecutive pecks for a longer period during C (65% of the time) than M and A (54%). During C, the pecking rate was less for P (0.54 pecks/s) than for Po (0.79 pecks/s). Two consistent time patterns involving four acts frequently observed were: head rotation (or exploratory peck) double right arrow head in steady position double right arrow consumatory peck double right arrow head in steady position with jaw movements. Time intervals within a pattern were stable throughout sessions. However, the proportion of synchronized (included in a pattern) vs. nonsynchronized (not included in a pattern) acts decreased immediately after the change of feed form (session C). These results suggest that pecking at feed is composed of two distinct sets of acts: consistently organized patterns little affected by the form of the pecked particles and nonsynchronized acts that may be involved in sensory information.

Studies have demonstrated that appendage morphogenesis influences the expression of the appendage specific keratin genes. However, little is known about the nature of the structural genes expressed by the epidermal appendages of reptiles, How pattern formation and/or appendage morphogenesis influence terminal differentiation of reptilian appendages is not known. The epidermal appendages of reptiles and birds are characterized by the presence of both alpha (alpha) and beta (beta) type keratin proteins, Studies have focused on the genes of avian beta keratins because they are the major structural proteins of feathers. The occurrence of beta keratin proteins in the scales and claws of both birds and reptiles and their immunological cross-reactivity suggest that the genes for reptilian beta keratins may be homologous with those of birds, In bird appendages, the beta keratins are the products of a large family of homologous genes, Specific members of this gene family are expressed during the development of each appendage. Recent sequence analyses of feather beta keratins, from different orders of birds, demonstrate that there is more diversity at the DNA level than was implied by earlier protein sequencing studies, Immunological techniques show that the same antibodies that react with the epidermal beta keratins of the chicken (Gallus domesticus) react with the epidermal beta keratins of American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis), Furthermore, a peptide sequence (20 amino acids) from an alligator claw beta keratin is similar to a highly conserved region of avian claw scale, feather, and feather-like beta keratins.

As fearfulness and sociality are particularly influential traits in domesticated species, the finding that such traits respond to artificial selection may have important implications for poultry welfare and performance. However, it is not known if or how such selection has influenced human-animal interactions. The present experiment investigated the influence of fearfulness and SR behaviour on the ease with which birds could be caught and handled. Birds of lines selected for duration of the TI response or SR behaviour were reared in mixed Line groups (LTI and STI or HSR and LSR) of 491 and 346 birds, respectively, until 6 weeks of age. When the birds were 2, 4, and 6 weeks of age, they were caught one by one and their individual capture ranks noted, In the group of birds selected for duration of the TI response, birds selected of the Line selected for short duration of TI were caught before those selected for long duration of the response. In the group of birds selected for SR motivation, birds of the high line were caught before their low lines counterparts. Coefficients of concordance between capture ranks were significant and capture ranks did not differ significantly across ages. These results imply that selection for low levels of fear or high levels of sociality produces animals that are less disturbed by human interventions than animals selected for the opposite traits. The greater ease of capture of low fear line birds than high fear line birds may be explained by reduced fear of humans. The fact that the birds selected for high levels of SR behaviour are easier to catch than birds selected for low levels of sociality is less readily explicable. One hypothesis is that HSR line chicks tend to be more strongly imprinted on each other and the human caretaker. However, SR behaviour is highly species specific in both lines, existing evidence for line differences in social discrimination is limited and birds of the two lines show similar duration of the TI response. Despite this, whatever their underlying causation, these results demonstrate that genetic selection can be used to reduce negative reactions to human beings and may be of value in the improvement of both animal welfare and productivity.

We examined foraging patterns of arctic foxes at a large lesser snow goose (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) colony on Banks Island, Canada, from 1996 to 1998 and were especially interested in the proportion of food that was cached for later use and the impact that fox predation had on goose productivity. Arctic foxes took mostly eggs when foraging among geese, and most of these eggs (97%) were cached for later use. Adult geese and lemmings were taken in low numbers, and most of these foods (83% of geese and 75% of lemmings) were eaten immediately. In years with high fox abundance, the foxes spent considerable effort moving eggs from old caches. This behaviour may have resulted from high rates of cache pilfering, or foxes may have been moving caches to deter cache pilfering. The impact of fox predation was low in all years, and foxes look only about 4-8% of all eggs available at the colony during incubation each year. However, caching and use of cached eggs may influence the survival of arctic foxes by forming significant parts of their winter diet or by supplementing the diets of growing young: during nesting each year, foxes took on average 900-1570 eggs per fox.";"arctic fox; Alopex lagopus; Banks Island; food caching; foraging behaviours; lesser snow goose; Chen caerulescens; caerulescens";2000;"ARCTIC";"Environmental Sciences; Geography, Physical";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

In the spring and summer of 1992, however, the aerosol cloud resulting from the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo (Philippines) had reached the high northern latitudes and caused significant cooling in most of the Arctic, with widespread negative consequences for Arctic-breeding birds. At the same time, low abundance of small rodents and high abundance of predators presented additional problems for breeding birds in parts of the Palearctic. We compiled data on breeding biology of Arctic waterfowl and waders from more than 30 field studies to illuminate in what ways the circumpolar bad weather and predation influenced the breeding season of Arctic birds in 1992. Most projects reported a higher proportion of nonbreeders and a delayed onset of nest initiation compared to other years. Hatching and fledging success of the low number of late breeders was reduced. In addition, some projects reported lower clutch sizes and increased adult mortality. Detailed data from field studies are complemented by data on overall reproductive success of waterfowl and wader populations collected from staging and wintering grounds. In total, there was an almost complete reproductive failure for waders and waterfowl throughout the Arctic in 1992, suggesting a short-term effect on global waterbird populations.

Additionally, researchers have suggested that the amount of available escape cover in a landscape could alter winter survival of bobwhites. A comparative study of winter bobwhite ecology was conducted on rangeland and cropland ecosystems in east-central Kansas (11 November - 31 January 1993-1996). We considered woody cover type on our study areas to be an escape cover for quail. We used radiotelemetry to investigate survival, movement, and cover-type selection. Over the 3-year period, we monitored 91 individuals on a cropland study area (CSA) and 66 birds on a rangeland study area (RSA). Survival was higher on the CSA (0.46) than on the RSA (0.27) (P = 0.03); the difference was due to increased harvest mortality on the RSA (P = 0.04). Mean daily covey movement was higher on the RSA than on the CSA (P < 0.01). Comparing cover-type selection between study areas, it was found that bobwhites selected cropland more on the RSA than on the CSA (P < 0.01). On the RSA, increased daily movement correlated with decreased selection for woody cover and increased selection for cropland (P < 0.02). On the CSA, increased woody-cover selection decreased natural predation (P = 0.03). On the RSA, decreased movement, increased woody cover, and decreased pasture selection reduced natural predation (P < 0.05).

The birds expressed all the phases, except migration. Activity was arrhythmic when they were moulting. A circadian rhythm of feeding activity appeared during the fattening phase. in males, the circadian period lengthened and the clarity of the rhythm increased during sexual development.

This is due to Ro for the parasite being 1.23 when infecting pheasants, but only 0.0057 when infecting partridges. Thus, when the pheasant is present in the model the partridge population is impacted by the shared parasite but, when the pheasant is absent, the parasite is lost from the system. 3, Based on best available parameter estimates, the observed impact of H. gallinarum on the grey partridge may be sufficient to cause exclusion when the pheasant is present in the model. This supports the hypothesis that the UK grey partridge decline observed over the past 50 years may be partly due to apparent competition with pheasants, 4, Habitat separation between the two host species, where it decreases the rate of H. gallinarum transmission from the pheasant to the partridge, may allow them to co-exist in the field in the presence of the parasite.

The provision of cover and the botanical and structural complexity of the vegetation are also important. However, large hedges do not suit all species; birds tend to prefer hedgerow types which most closely resemble their usual non-hedgerow breeding habitat. The value of hedgerows to birds can be increased by combining them with other features such as headlands (for game birds), verges, wildflower strips, game and wild-bird cover and well-vegetated banks and ditches. The presence of well-grown, dead or decaying trees is beneficial to many species, providing nest holes, foraging sites and perches. Increasing the structural complexity of a hedgerow and its associated habitat may also reduce the incidence of predation. Hedgerows also provide physical shelter and roost sites and are an important source of winter food supplies, especially berries and other fruits. Some bird species, usually those whose primary habitat is woodland, live mainly within the hedgerow itself, whereas others are more dependent on the surrounding landscape to a greater or lesser extent. However, even the presence of woodland bird species is influenced by the availability and characteristics of alternative habitats in the surroundings and therefore hedgerows and their bird populations do not function as isolated patches. As linear landscape elements, hedgerows also provide safe cover for both local and larger-scale movements and may facilitate access to resources or habitat which might otherwise be too risky or too remote for birds to use or colonise. A number of recommendations for improving hedgerow habitat for birds are reiterated from an extensive literature and include combining hedgerows with other semi-natural habitat, providing a variety of structural types, maintaining good cover in the hedge-base, e.g. by excluding stock and herbicide, and avoiding excessive cutting. However, good hedgerow management has costs and is unlikely to be applied widely in the absence of national policy and funding.

Among these techniques, an entirely in vitro system for embryo production is effectively an important tool for conservation of wildlife. In the last decade, progress has been made in embryo production in carnivores. It has been shown that canine oocytes can resume meiosis in vitro and that these oocytes can be fertilized and developed in vitro, although at a much lower rate than most other domestic animal oocytes. The reason lies in the dissimilarities of reproductive physiology of the dog compared to other species and the lack of precise information concerning the oviductal environment, in which oocyte maturation, fertilization and early embryonic development take place. Successful in vitro embryo production in the domestic cat has been attained with oocytes matured in vitro, and kittens were born after transfer of IVM/IVF derived embryos. On the basis of these results the in vitro fertilization of oocytes has also been applied in several non-domestic feline species. The effectiveness of such protocols in the preservation of genetic material of rare species can be improved by developing better techniques for long-term storage of gametes. In dogs and cats sperm cells have been successfully frozen and the cryopreservation of oocytes would greatly increase their availability for a range of reproductive technologies. Cryopreserved cat oocytes can be fertilized successfully and their development in vitro after fertilization is enhanced when mature oocytes are frozen. Thus refined techniques of oocyte maturation and fertilization in vitro coupled with oocyte cryopreservation could allow for an easy establishment of genetic combinations when male and female gametes in the desired combination are not simultaneously available, and the propagation of endangered carnivores would be facilitated.";"canine; feline; in vitro embryo production";2000;"REPRODUCTION NUTRITION DEVELOPMENT";"Developmental Biology; Nutrition & Dietetics; Reproductive Biology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

During the last half century there has been an enormous 'natural experiment', in which forestry in Finland has been very intensive, whereas in Karelia forestry has been negligent leaving large primaeval areas untouched. As a result, Russian forests have a much greater diversity of wildlife. In particular, rare species and species favouring old forests are more abundant in Karelia than in Finland. Typical dominant species in Finland are those characteristic of younger successional stages as well as many vole-dependent small carnivores. Finland is situated on the eastern margin of a vast coniferous taiga. The future of the taiga fauna in Fennoscandia is dependent on the condition of the taiga forests in Russia and on the connectivity of Fennoscandian forest areas to the intact taiga, i.e. connectivity at the border between Russia and Finland. In this paper, we focus our attention on the narrow isthmus between the White Sea and Lake Onega, which is an extremely important connection for the northern element of the taiga fauna. The capercaillie Tetrao urogallus may be a good focal species, with its large spatial requirements for lek areas depicting the need for connectivity to maintain viable populations. We suggest that large-scale connections should be planned, 'forest bridges' intruding into Finland and even into Sweden, where the proportion of mature forests would be high enough las much as 1/3 of the total area) to guarantee the connectivity between subpopulations. We argue that this may not necessarily represent additional costs for forestry, provided that actions are taken for a careful large-scale planning of forest harvesting to satisfy the requirements of these corridors. We believe that large-scale preservation of ecosystems will be a better strategy in the future than species-specific conservation programmes for wildlife species.";"capercaillie; connectivity; Fennoscandia; forestry; game communities; landscape ecology";2000;"WILDLIFE BIOLOGY";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Raccoons (Procyon lotor) and other small carnivores are very attracted to deer feeders and are potential predators of ground-nesting birds such as wild turkeys. We tested the hypothesis that predation on artificial ground nests was greater near deer feeders due to the increased presence of nest predators. We selected 2 ponds and 2 artificial water sources (windmills with troughs) on the basis of habitat similarity. We provided supplemental food in the form of shelled corn at one of each of the pond and windmill sites during 1997, 1998, and 1999. At each site we placed 50 artificial nests (3 chicken eggs) along a 800- x 40-m transect centered on the water source. We monitored the fate of these nests over 28 days. We identified nest predators through patterns of eggshell breakage, hair traps, and automatic cameras. We analyzed nest survival using a logit model and by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Raccoons and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis were the most common predators of the artificial nests. In years with adequate ground cover to conceal the nests, presence of supplemental deer feeders at the site significantly decreased survivorship of the artificial nests. In dry years with sparse ground cover, nest survivorship was extremely poor at all sites. The lack of cover for the nests outweighed any deleterious effects of the deer feeders. Previous studies have suggested that supplementing predators may be a way to reduce nest predation; our results suggest the contrary. We suggest that managers concerned with production of wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) and other ground-nesting birds should avoid placing deer feeders in nesting habitat or avoid supplemental feeding during the nesting season.";"artificial nests; deer; nest predation; raccoon; supplemental feeding; wild turkey";2000;"WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN";"Biodiversity Conservation";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We used this system to investigate the response of macrophage/microglial cells to neuronal degeneration in the embryonic brain. Colchicine was injected into the right eye of quail or chick embryos at a time when the survival of ION neurons depends on retrograde trophic support from the retina, and the chronology of the subsequent macrophage/microglial response in the ION was analyzed. This response was restricted to the ION contralateral to the injected eye; no modifications of the normal state were observed in the surrounding parenchyma or in the opposite ION, used as control. The response was first detected 18 hours after the colchicine injection (18 hours pi), when an increase of the macrophage/microglial cell number was evident. The number of these cells in the affected ION increased, peaking at 40-48 hours pi. At later survival times, macrophage/microglial cells were progressively less abundant in the affected ION, which gradually diminished in size. At 120 hours pi the only remnant of the ION was a small cluster of macrophage/microglial cells, surrounded by a clear area with scarce nonmicroglial cells, in the region formerly occupied by the ION. This study reveals that a strong macrophage/ microglial response occurs in the embryonic brain in response to neuronal degeneration but that these cells do not trigger the neuronal death, as they only appear after pyknotic fragments are already observable.

One fundamental question facing restoration ecologists attempting to restore wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) populations is the number of birds to release per restoration site. We describe the development of a simulation model capable of evaluating a variety of stocking strategies for eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris). Simulation results suggest that in the coniferous and deciduous forests of east Texas, supplemental (multiple) stockings do not use difficult-to-procure broodstock as effectively as initially stocking new sites. We also found that using juvenile females or a combination of 50% adult and 50% juvenile females significantly (P < 0.032) increased turkey survival. Based upon these data, it appears that biologists attempting to restore wild turkeys in east Texas should use the higher stocking rates we evaluated and greater than or equal to 50% juvenile females during releases. Models that simulate the dynamics of relocated populations benefit restoration efforts by allowing restoration ecologists to evaluate various stocking strategies quickly and inexpensively prior to initiating costly restoration programs.

If it occurs in a flock, more and more birds show it within a short period of time. A possible mechanism is social transmission. Several studies have shown that laying hen chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, are able to modify their own behaviour when observing the behaviour of other chicks, for example, when feeding and foraging. As there is good experimental evidence that feather pecking originates from foraging behaviour, we hypothesized that feather pecking could also be socially transmitted. To test this, we reared 16 groups of 30 chicks. After week 4, the birds were regrouped into 16 groups of 20 chicks into each of which we introduced either five chicks that showed high frequencies of feather pecking or, as controls, five chicks that had not developed feather pecking. We then determined the feather-pecking rate and the frequency of ft,raging, dustbathing, feeding, drinking, preening, moving, standing and resting of all birds in a group. Data from the introduced birds were analysed separately and excluded from the group data. Chicks in groups with introduced feather-pecking chicks had a significantly higher feather-pecking sate than chicks in the control groups. In addition, birds in groups with introduced feather peckers showed significantly lower foraging frequencies than those in the control groups, although the housing conditions were identical and there were no differences in either the number or the quality of the stimuli relevant to foraging behaviour. The study therefore suggests that feather pecking is socially transmitted in groups of laying hen chicks.

Almost all recruitment for both sexes, particularly females, was of birds produced outside local populations and also external to nearby studied populations. Populations were more dependent on female recruitment than on male recruitment to sustain them, and patterns of recruitment were not correlated with local survival of adults or production of young the previous year, except at one site for females. Over 95% of recruits were yearlings. Breeding dispersal of adults, an infrequent but regular event, was also important to interpopulation connectivity. Our data for multiple populations allowed us to describe movement patterns among populations to assess consistency with conditions required for a rescue system. After widespread reproductive failure in one year, we expected all populations the next year would have low recruitment due to a reduced supply of recruits produced in the region. Recruitment was low, bur impact varied among populations. We conducted an overwinter study of radio-marked offspring to determine possible influences of winter site location and relatives on recruitment patterns. Contrary to expectation, offspring remained on or near breeding sites in winter, but were not located near their mothers or siblings. Recruitment location was related to winter site location.

In order to examine whether this increase has negative consequences for partridge chicks, a controlled experiment was carried out. Four groups of partridge chicks were fed different diets of fixed mixtures of grasshoppers and aphids, with aphid contents ranging from 0% to 45% wet weight. One additional group was allowed to select how much to eat of aphids and grasshoppers (self-selection). 2. Over the run of the 5-day experiment the self-selecting chicks ate 7% wet weight of aphids and showed a higher growth rate than all groups on fixed diets. 3. Increasing the proportion of aphids in the chick diet above the self-selected level had negative consequences for chick growth and flight feather development. 4. Food consumption and growth efficiency were markedly lower when chicks were fed a diet with a high proportion of aphids. 5.

One such model operates through kin favouritism facilitating the recruitment of young cock red grouse. We investigated whether recruitment by young cocks depended on the presence and spatial arrangement of elder relatives in the territorial population. We used molecular genetic estimates of relatedness, and checked for effects of covariates including natal territory size, hatching date, body size, parasite burdens and local density. Philopatric recruitment by cock red grouse led to the formation of clusters of contiguous territories owned by kin. The probability that an individual young cock would establish a territory increased with the number of kin in his father's cluster. This pattern might have been due to genetic quality determining both recruitment success and the size of the paternal cluster. If so, there should have been a positive correlation between a young cock's probability of recruitment and the number of his relatives in the population, irrespective of their spatial distribution. This did not occur and so the effect of cluster size is unlikely to have been confounded by genetic quality.

In a first experiment chicks were subjected to 18L:6D, 15L:9D, 12L:12D, 9L:15D, or 6L:18D, with ad lib food during the light period. In a second experiment birds were exposed to a long photoperiod (18L:6D or 15L:9D) with ad lib food during part of the light period (first 6 or 9 h, respectively). Longer photoperiods were associated with larger weight gains. In 18L:6D broilers total body weight gain was 262 g compared to 213 g in 6L:18D broilers. In layers, corresponding values were 182 and 131 g. This effect of photoperiod on weight gain was primarily due to the effect of photoperiod on food availability. The photoperiod below which detrimental effects on weight gain occurred was 9L:15D for both strains. Chicks subjected to 9L:15D or 6L:18D exploited crop filling to enhance energy intake. They also decreased nocturnal metabolic rates to a greater extent compared to levels during the light phase than chicks subjected to light periods of 12 h or more. Sexual maturation was stimulated by photoperiod. At the age of 71 days, eight out of nine females subjected to 18L:6D were producing eggs, but none of the 6L:18D females. It is concluded that changes in feeding behavior and energy expenditure shown under short photoperiods are part of a strategy that allow chicks to gain weight continuously.

Using the avian embryo as a model, we previously reported that ET3 promotes the survival and proliferation of unipotent melanocyte and bipotent glia-melanocyte precursors in trunk NC cultures. Here we investigated whether, at later stages, embryonic pigment cells respond to ET3. Such a possibility is supported by the previous finding that, in vivo, avian melanocytes express endothelin receptor B2 (ETRB2) during migration and after their differentiation in the skin. We found that in vitro ET3 exerts a dose-dependent stimulation of proliferation and melanogenesis in NC cells that had homed to the epidermis of embryonic quail dorsal skin. Moreover, in clonal cultures of skin-derived pigment cells, ET3 induces rapid cell divisions of clonogenic melanocytes that generate a mixed progeny of melanocytes and cells devoid of pigment granules and expressing glial markers in more than 40% of the colonies. It can therefore be concluded that ET3 is strongly mitogenic to embryonic pigment cells and able to alter their differentiation program, leading them to recapitulate the glial-melanocyte bipotentiality of their NC ancestors.";"epidermis; quail embryo; clonal cultures; transdifferentiation; Schwann cell myelin protein";2000;"PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA";"Multidisciplinary Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The use of AI with frozen-thawed semen as a breeding tool to overcome breeding incompatibility or to preserve male genetic material has been limited in felines in contrast to the situation in domestic dogs and foxes. In many research scenarios and endangered felid species programs, the in vitro production of feline embryos with subsequent transfer has complemented the use of AI. Improvement of IVM, in vitro fertilization (IVF) and embryo culture coupled with ovarian tissue grafting, cryobanking of follicles, oocytes, semen, or embryos, with subsequent ET into surrogate females, may render this technology feasible for use in endangered wild felids, In canines, reliable systems for in vitro production of embryos, embryo cryopreservation and transfer are yet to be developed. The refinement of invasive fertilization techniques, such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), may eventually provide a tool for removal of recipient oocyte nuclei and transfer of selected embryonic or somatic cell donor nuclei into domestic cat ooplasm, thereby providing a tool for genetic modification, or for preservation of valuable genetic material.

One suggested benefit of conspicuousness is that it enables the prey to be detected at a greater distance, allowing a predator more time to make a correct decision about attacking it and thus reducing possible recognition errors made by predators. I conducted an experiment, with chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, as predators on live aposematic and nonaposematic prey, to investigate the effects of decision time and signal size on predator sampling behaviour. The chicks were subjected to different degrees of competition to influence how quickly decisions had to be made. Chicks in four treatment groups, either in the presence or absence of a competing chick, were presented with either solitary prey or prey in groups. In the presence of a competitor, chicks attacked the prey more often and more quickly and needed more attacks before they started to avoid the prey. With prey in groups, chicks took longer to attack, attacked less often, learnt to avoid prey more quickly and killed fewer aposematic prey. This experiment provides evidence for the importance of time and signal size for predators' attack decisions. More time to view prey prior to attack could produce a stronger image and thus encourage avoidance learning and produce a stronger neophobic avoidance effect.

When both types of cue were relevant, LE made greater use of positional cues than the other two groups, as has been previously found, whereas RE made greater use of local (colour) cues.

Right/left differences emerge when RE and LE can be used in different ways during training. In Experiments 4-5 Bin chicks were shown to turn preferentially to the right during wide-angle search, when relying on local, and to the left when relying on positional cues.

It usually bulges into the subgerminal space and is localized near the caudo-lateral border of the area pellucida after approximately one day incubation. The sickle canal, which is always visible on sections, is found both in the chicken and in the quail blastoderm. It seems to function as an expansion space for lateral migration of mesoblast cells, between epiblast and endoblast. The origin and evolution of the sickle canal have been followed (using quail-chick chimeras). by apposing quail Rauber's sickle fragments on fragments of unincubated chicken blastoderms. It was seen that part of the wall of the sickle canal is formed by endoblast derived from Rauber's sickle, i.e, transitional and junctional endoblast. Very obvious, on sections through the chimeras, is the intimate contact between the V or U-shaped quail junctional endoblast and the first formed blood islands, developing from mesoblast that migrates peripherally over the sickle canal. Our study demonstrates that even in the absence of the area opaca, a sickle canal forms and blood islands start to develop from mesoblast of the area pellucida under the influence of junctional endoblast (derived from Rauber's sickle). Rauber's sickle and its derivatives seem thus to be the major organizers of the avian blastoderm. During early incubation they induce the formation of endomesoblast ingressing via the primitive streak (CALLEBAUT & VAN NUETEN, 1994), and somewhat later junctional endoblast induces the development of blood islands from the most laterally ingressed mesoderm.";"avian blastoderm; Rauber's sickle; sickle canal; junctional endoblast; blood islands";2000;"BELGIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY";"Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The indicators of breeding success were the proportion of grouse hens with a brood and brood size. Two study areas teach 45 000 km(2)) in the boreal zone were selected for investigation. The breeding success of grouse was negatively correlated with both fragmentation of forest area per se by farmland and the: decreasing proportion of older forest as a result of clear-cutting. The extent of landscape accounting best for variation in nesting success was an order of magnitude larger (similar to 100 km(2)) than the area most probably used by a grouse female and her brood during the summer, which suggests that landscape scale factors may override local factors such as track size and distance from edge. The proportion of grouse hens with a brood was lower in heavily fragmented landscapes than in more continuous forest landscapes whereas only minor differences in brood size were detected. We suggest that the most likely cause of the observed spatial correlation was higher nest predation by generalist predators in fragmented forest landscapes. The effects of landscape composition on the breeding success of grouse were more marked in northern than in southern Finland, probably because predator populations are more food-regulated in the north. The diminished breeding success of forest grouse as a result of increased forest fragmentation is a probable cause of population declines in forest grouse species during the past decades in Fennoscandia.";"Black Grouse; Capercaillie; Finland; forest fragmentation; Geographic Information Systems (GIS); landscape ecology; landscape structure; nest loss; predation; Tetrao tetrix; Tetrao urogallus; tetraonids";2000;"ECOLOGY";"Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Time series data on five species of gamebird from the Dolomitic Alps were used to examine the relative importance of dispersal and common stochastic events in causing synchrony between spatially structured populations. 2. Cross-correlation analysis of detrended time series was used to describe the spatial pattern of fluctuations in abundance, while standardized time series were used to describe both fluctuations and the trend in abundance. There were large variations in synchrony both within and between species and only weak negative relationships with distance. 3. Species in neighbouring habitats were more likely to be in synchrony than species separated by several habitats. Species with similar density-dependent structure were more likely to be in synchrony. 4. In order to estimate the relative importance of dispersal and environmental stochasticity, we modelled the spatial dynamics of each species using two different approaches. First, we used estimating functions and bootstrapping of time series data to calculate the relative importance of dispersal and stochastic effects for each species. Second, we estimated the intensity of environmental stochasticity from climatic records during the breeding season and then modelled the dispersal rate and dispersal distance for each species. The two models exhibited similar results for rock ptarmigan, black grouse, hazel grouse and rock partridge, while contrasting patterns were observed for capercaillie. 5.

The conversion of testosterone to estradiol by brain aromatase is also known to regulate male aggression in the breeding season. Male song sparrows (Melospiza melodia morphna) are territorial not only in the breeding season, but also in the nonbreeding season, when plasma testosterone and estradiol levels are basal. Castration has no effect on nonbreeding aggression. In contrast, chronic (10 day) aromatase inhibitor (fadrozole) treatment decreases nonbreeding aggression, indicating a role for estrogens. Here, we show that acute (1 day) fadrozole treatment decreases nonbreeding territoriality, suggesting relatively rapid estrogen effects. In spring, fadrozole decreases brain aromatase activity, but acute and chronic fadrozole treatments do not significantly decrease aggression, although trends for some behaviors approach significance. In gonadally intact birds, fadrozole may be less effective at reducing aggression in the spring. This might occur because fadrozole causes a large increase in plasma testosterone in intact breeding males. Alternatively, estradiol may be more important for territoriality in winter than spring.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of a midbrain vocal nucleus, the nucleus intercollicularis, in the production of the acoustic and postural components of crowing in quail. Brief electrical stimuli were applied to the nucleus intercollicularis during spontaneously emitted crows in quail with chronically implanted electrodes, to determine if perturbing neural activity in the nucleus intercollicularis resulted in a disruption of ongoing crowing behavior. The most common effect of such stimuli was a concurrent, premature termination of both the acoustic and head movement components of the crow.

We assigned nestlings between 3 and 7 d of age to one of the following treatments: (1) food restriction, which resulted in a slowed growth at the rate found in undernourished, wild nestlings; (2) overfeeding, which totally suppressed begging; and (3) intermediate feeding. Threefold differences in energy consumption caused fivefold differences in body mass increments of the nestlings. Despite this, body mass-corrected RMR and intestinal mass were not affected by the feeding regime. The energy content of fecal output was highest in food-restricted birds, while their carcass fat content was lowest among treatment groups. Intestinal uptake rates of L-proline were low in the overfed and intermediate-fed young but significantly increased in the food-restricted birds, who attempted to maximize their rates of growth and development within the restrictive limits set by feeding regime. We noted a marked decrease of intestinal villi height in overfed birds as compared to intermediate-fed and food-restricted nestlings. We conclude that song thrush nestlings are characterized by a limited plasticity of their developmental program, which prohibits overfed nestlings from significantly up-regulating their gut function to accommodate increased food intake. This suggests that they already grew at a rate close to their physiological maximum.

However, little is known about its function in other vertebrates. As a first step toward investigating the function of CGRP in birds, its distribution was studied in the domestic chick and quail brain by means of immunocytochemistry, by using antibodies against rat CGRP. The distribution of CGRP immunoreactivity in the chick and quail central nervous system was found to be similar. CGRP-immunoreactive (CGRPi) perikarya were not present in the telencephalon. In the diencephalon, CGRPi perikarya were present mainly in the shell of the thalamic nucleus ovoidalis, the nucleus semilunaris paraovoidalis, the nucleus dorsolateralis posterior thalami, and in the hypothalamic nucleus of the ansa lenticularis. In the brainstem, CGRPi perikarya were present in the nucleus mesencephalicus nervi trigemini, the nucleus tegmenti ventralis, the locus coeruleus, the nucleus linearis caudalis and in the parabrachial region. In addition CGRPi perikarya were found in the motor nuclei of the III, IV, V, VI, VII, IX, X, and XII cranial nerves. The telencephalon contained CGRPi fibres within the paleostriatal complex (mainly in the ventral paleostriatum), parts of the neostriatum and ventral hyperstriatum, parts of the archistriatum, and the septum. In the diencephalon, the densest plexus of CGRPi fibres was observed in the dorsal reticular thalamus. A less dense CGRPi innervation was present in some dorsal thalamic nuclei and in the medial and periventricular hypothalamus. The pretectum and midbrain tegmentum also contained CGRPi fibres, whereas the optic tectum was virtually devoid of immunolabelling. Scattered CGRPi fibres were observed in the central grey and neighbouring pontine areas. Some of the sensory fibres of the trigeminal, vagal, glossopharyngeal, and spinal nerves were also CGRPi. The results of comparative studies indicate that the presence of CGRP in some thalamo-telencephalic projections is a primitive feature of the forebrain of amniotes. Therefore, the brain areas giving rise to and receiving such a projection in different vertebrates, are likely to be homologous. J. Comp. Neurol. 421:515-532, 2000.

In a previous study, domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, that had a PS under 65%,were classed as 'poor learners' and those with a PS greater than 65% were called 'good learners'. We tested the effects of continued imprinting training in chicks from these two categories. After exposure to an imprinting stimulus for 30 min on day 1 after hatching, preferences were tested and then the chicks were exposed to the same stimulus for either 90 min, 3 h or 4 h on the next day, followed by a second preference test. In all these experiments there was a significant improvement in mean I'S in the 'poor learners' between the first and second test, such that these chicks acquired a significant mean preference for the training stimulus. There was no such improvement in chicks that did not receive further training on day 2. When absolute approach was analysed, there was no significant difference between 'poor learners' and 'good learners' at the second test, after 4 h of retraining. Overall, mean preference scores increased with length of training. These results suggest that 'poor learners' are better characterized as 'slow learners', and that their initially low PS is not caused by, for example, a lack of motivation to express a preference. Preference scores reflect the strength of learning during imprinting.

Given its simplicity, rapidity and non-invasiveness, the T-maze test might represent a commercially attractive selection criterion for future breeding programmes if this behavioural trait exhibits sufficient genetic variability. However, it is first necessary to ensure that performance in the T-maze is not sensitive to potentially confounding variables, such as existing preferences to turn right or left at the junction of the maze, the order of testing, or the time of day. In the present study, 240 newly hatched, mixed-sex broiler chicks (Cobb) were randomly allocated to 12 groups of 20 upon receipt. When they were 2 days of age a group of 20 chicks was placed in the brood area of each of two T-mazes at 0830 h; the brood areas were positioned on either the right or the left sides of the mazes. After acclimatisation, one chick from each group was placed in the isolation chamber of the T-maze and we recorded the time it took to traverse the maze. This procedure was repeated until all 20 chicks and all 12 groups had been tested. The locations of the brood areas were rotated after each block of 20 tests. Testing was completed in the same day and two groups were tested at each of the following times: 0900, 1030, 1200, 1330. 1500, and 1630 h. Analysts of variance (ANOVA) revealed no detectable effects of: positioning the brood area on the right or the left side of the T-maze (F-1,F-200 = 0.06, P < 0.80), test order (F-19,F-200 = 0.48; P < 0.96), or time-of-day (F-5,F-234 = 0.44; P < 0.81). These findings strongly suggest that the future classification and possible selection of broiler chicks according to their T-maze responses are unlikely to be confounded by right-left preferences, test order, or the time of day.

Plasma levels of AVT increased about 1.5-fold after the administration of 1.5 M NaCl (200 mu l, ip) or 100 ng AII (5 mu l, icv). The administration of the mu-antagonist naloxonazine and the kappa-antagonist nor-Binaltorphimine further elevated plasma levels of AVT stimulated by hypertonic NaCl or AII. These effects of mu- and kappa-opioid receptor antagonists on AVT release were dose dependent. Nor-Binaltorphimine enhanced hyperosmotically stimulated plasma levels of AVT at a lower dose than that of naloxonazine. Conversely, the delta-selective antagonist naltrindole did not significantly affect AVT secretion. None of the opioid receptor antagonists influenced basal plasma levels of AVT. Therefore, these results suggest that mu- and kappa-opioid receptors are involved in hyperosmotic- and AII-induced AVT release, and the effect of the kappa-opioid receptor antagonist in the AVT release stimulated by hyperosmolality is strong compared to that of the mu-opioid receptor antagonist.

Bird populations can be efficiently managed only if the demographic mechanisms that cause change are correctly understood. Here we illustrate the demographic variables causing decline among grey partridge Perdix perdix populations in France by comparing populations that show contrasting trends. The analysis combined a field survey at 10 contrasting sites during 3 years, modelling and statistical analyses; survival rates and reproductive success were estimated through the largest-ever radio-tracking study of hens, while density was estimated through counts. 2. Population viability analyses showed that, in France, north-western populations of grey partridge were healthy whereas south-eastern populations were declining. 3. Elasticity analyses accounting for environmental stochasticity indicated that the survival rate during shooting, over winter and at the time of the first nesting attempt were the most important demographic influences on population growth rate. The hatching rate, covey size at hatching of first clutches and chick survival rate were secondary. The contribution of replacement clutches to population change was low. 4. Multiple regression showed that hen survival during the first nesting attempt explained 33% of the variability in the population growth rate across populations. The shooting pressure increased with the health of the population. 5. Improving survival rate during winter and the first nesting attempt was not sufficient for recovery in a declining population. It was also necessary to increase simultaneously the hatching rate of first clutches and chick survival rate to produce a stable population that could sustain shooting. 6. Low hen survival rates, in particular during the breeding period, explain the recent decline of grey partridge populations in some regions of France. However, the recovery of populations will need a simultaneous improvement of several demographic parameters.";"life-cycle; modelling; population growth; shooting; survival rate";2000;"JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY";"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

If establishment and/or survival of parasites is limited by host immunity, we would expect increased parasite intensities in animals with high organochlorine burdens, such as the glaucous gull Larus hyperboreus. 2.

The rodent population cycles of northern latitudes can be seen as both predictable and unpredictable, depending on the scale in time and space. The arctic fox Alopex lagopus is an opportunistic carnivore, but paradoxically, it seems to function as a specialist on fluctuating rodent Arvicolinae populations in most inland areas. We have studied the dietary response of arctic foxes in Sweden during 5 years of varying abundance of Norwegian lemming Lemmus lemmus, and how these changes influenced the reproductive success of the foxes. The arctic fox population on mainland Fennoscandia is threatened by extinction and the situation has deteriorated during the 1980s and 1990s because of an absence of lemming peaks. Our results showed that in all years, lemming was the main prey for arctic foxes, with 85% frequency of occurrence in summer faeces (scats). Bird remains (mainly Passeriformes) were present in 34% of the seats, reindeer Rangifer tarandus in 21%, voles and shrews in 4% and hares Lepus timidus in 2% of the seats. The occurrences of lemming, bird and larger mammal (reindeer and hare) remains in the seats varied significantly between years. Temporal Variations within summer seasons and dietary differences between sub-areas, indicated that arctic foxes fed opportunistically on the alternative prey types. Den occupancy rates were positively correlated with lemming population densities during the previous winter, indicating a strong numerical response. We conclude that from a functional aspect, the arctic fox in Sweden is a lemming specialist, since lemming is the main prey and their abundance is the best predictor of arctic fox reproductive success. Other prey are used opportunistically in relation to their availability.";"Alopex lagopus; diet; predation; numerical response; functional response";2000;"JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY";"Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The present study addresses the role: of DHT synthesis in regulating male sexual behavior by inhibiting 5 alpha-reductase, the enzyme that converts T into DHT. In two separate experiments (one replacement and one maintenance paradigm), breeding adult males were castrated and implanted with capsules of T. DI-IT, or a control capsule (blank, BL). The animals were then injected with the Sa-reductase inhibitor, FCE, or with steroid suspending vehicle (SSV) as a control. Both experiments produced similar results. Overall, T was most effective in eliciting courtship and copulatory behaviors above control levels. In both experiments, treatment with FCE attenuated the T-induced effects on courtship behavior, whereas the inhibition of 5 alpha-reductase activity resulted in modest and inconsistent effects on the latency to intromission and the proportion of copulating males. DHT treatment did not significantly increase courtship or copulatory behaviors above control levels. These results suggest that (a) 5 alpha-reductase activity is necessary but that DHT alone is not sufficient for stimulating courtship in male A. carolinensis; and (b) courtship behavior is more sensitive than copulatory behavior to thr activity of the androgen metabolizing enzyme.

Avoidance of pine Pinus sylvestris was the only habitat effect in the hazel grouse/habitat analyses that was significant through all scales, seasons and densities. Thus, in spite of long-term data on a well-known species and detailed vegetation descriptions, only a few clear patterns relating to hazel grouse habitat selection were found at the relatively small scales analysed. We conclude that the non-significant relationships were due to the generally suitable composition and small variation of habitats within the study area, and that significant results may not be expected within the scales analysed and with the methods used. Thus, to find associations between animal species and habitats, a suitable study area must include a certain degree of habitat variation and the relationships should probably be examined at a scale equal to or larger than the home-range of the species in question, or considerably larger if population data are available.

However, it was not clear if this was due to different food preferences or distinct habitat use. Since the arctic fox is an endangered species in Fennoscandia, it is important to know whether the superior, north spreading red fox can oust it from the tundra habitat, or if food specialisation may prevent displacement. In a feeding experiment at the Lycksele Zoo in northern Sweden, we compared the food preferences of two arctic and two red foxes. Our results show that the four individuals responded similarly to a variety of food items, and particularly that the two species were not distinct in their food preferences concerning lemmings and voles.

The sections consisted of steel wire, steel netting or a combination of these, and ranged in height from 100 to 250 cm. The fieldwork took the form of spring patrols during which dead birds and their remains were searched for along the fences immediately after snow melt. We covered a total of 179.9 km and found 253 collision victims belonging to at least 20 species. Of the 253 victims found, 215 were willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus and rock ptarmigan L. mutus; thus these two species comprised 85% of the victims. During the winters of 1992/93 and 1993/94, we carried out experiments with dummy willow ptarmigan which were placed along fence sections and monitored serving as artificial fence-strike victims. Our experiments showed that approximately 64% of the total number of ptarmigan killed by the fences during winter would be detected during spring patrols along the fences. The type and height of the fence had no effect on the ptarmigan collision rate. In contrast, both the fence section and year factor contributed significantly to the observed variation in collision rate.

We consider three management options for the allele: ignoring it, eliminating it by selection and minimizing its phenotypic manifestation by avoiding matings between possible carriers. We recommend minimizing its phenotypic expression because an unacceptably large proportion of condors (up to 78 out of 146) would be prevented from breeding under a selection strategy designed to eliminate the allele.

In experiment 1, behavioural reactions of eight male blue foxes to wooden blocks were videotaped between January and May. In experiment 2, 16 male blue foxes were housed singly in cages with wooden blocks and 16 without between January and June. Pencil, confrontation, feeding and open field tests were carried out. Furthermore, 50 female blue foxes were kept singly in cages with wooden blocks and 49 without from January to July. Both groups were bred and the whelping result was recorded. In-cage behavioural tests were performed three rimes. Results showed that interactions with the wooden blocks were frequent, averaging 77 interactions fox(-1) day(-1). Interactions with blocks decreased slightly with time. Blocks were mainly used for carrying, chewing, poking and sniffing. In the confrontation test, male foxes housed without blocks were more passive than those with blocks. No differences were found between the groups in the pencil, feeding or open field tests.

Bright plumage is one of the most noticeable sexual signals and is often used by females as a basis for mate choice. Yet bright male plumage is not necessarily testosterone dependent. We investigated the role of testosterone in the moult into seasonal nuptial plumage in male superb fairy-wrens. Early pre-nuptial moult is under intense intersexual selection and males can acquire the bright plumage any time between autumn and the next spring. Testosterone was always undetectable or very low in males in dull eclipse plumage. During the pre-nuptial moult, both the number of males with detectable testosterone and average testosterone levels increased sharply. High testosterone was more correlated with nuptial plumage than with presence of the cloacal protuberance (indicative of sperm storage). Subcutaneous testosterone implants always induced the pre-nuptial moult within 2-3 weeks after implantation, even well outside the natural time range of moulting. Moreover, removal of the implants before the nuptial plumage was completed, arrested the moult process. The evidence suggests that development of the nuptial plumage is testosterone dependent, although we cannot exclude that testosterone exerts its action after conversion to a metabolite such as oestrogen. Once the nuptial plumage was completed, all males maintained substantially elevated testosterone, sometimes months before the onset of breeding. These high levels could be necessary to maintain the plumage, and/or are involved in courtship displays. The results are discussed with respect to potential costs involved in acquiring and maintaining the nuptial plumage.";"testosterone; sexual selection; pre-nuptial moult; sexual dichromatism; honest signalling";2000;"BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY";"Behavioral Sciences; Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The helminth community was depauperate, probably because of the high trophic dependence of the gullery on waste food from refuse dumps. The prevalences of two helminth species varied both among years and between the sexes of gulls, while the intensity of parasitism did not vary significantly for any helminth species. No clear pattern of association between helminth species was detected, showing an unstructured helminth community in which the occurrence of any species was not restricted or favoured by the occurrence of any other species. The lack of associations might be influenced by the fact that only one core species occurred in the helminth community. Negative relationships were found between occurrence of certain helminths and body condition of hosts. Gulls infected by Tetrabothrius (Tetrabothrius) erostris were leaner than uninfected gulls; interestingly this negative relationship varied with the presence/absence of Cosmocephalus obvelatus. Moreover, body condition of gulls infected by C. obvelatus varied according to the year of sampling, while that of uninfected individuals showed no variability. High intensities of the parasites Eucoleus contortus and Brachylaima sp. were associated with poorer body condition of the host.

In birds and mammals sex is determined by a genetic mechanism. In mammals males are the heterogametic sex (XY) with the Y chromosome acting as a dominant determiner of sex due to the action of the testis-determining factor, SRY. In birds females are the heterogametic sex (ZW); however, it is not known whether the W chromosome carries a dominant ovary-determining gene, or whether Z chromosome dosage determines sex. Using an experimental approach, which assumes only that the sex-determining event in birds is accompanied by sex-specific changes in gene expression, we have identified a novel gene, ASW (Avian Sex-specific W-linked). The putative protein for ASW is related to the HIT (histidine triad) family of proteins. ASW shows female-specific expression in genital ridges and maps to the chicken W chromosome.

Particular emphasis was placed on finding naturally dispersed seeds in order to study the link between dispersal and postdispersal fate of seeds. Four species of birds (Emerald Toucanet, Aulacorhynchus prasinus; Resplendent Quetzal, Pharomachrus mocinno; Three-wattled Bellbird, Procnias tricarunculata; and Mountain Robin, Turdus plebejus) dispersed the seeds by regurgitation, and one species (Black Guan, Chamaepetes unicolor), by defecation. Most seeds (80%) were dispersed within 25 m of parent trees and under high (>92%) canopy cover. Bellbirds deposited 52% of the seeds they dispersed under habitual song perches in standing dead trees on the edges of treefall gaps >25 m from parent trees. In contrast, the other four species dispersed only 6% of the seeds they dispersed >25 m from parent trees, and <3% of the seeds were dispersed to gaps. Thus, male bellbirds provided predictable, nonrandom dispersal to a different microhabitat than the other four species. Seed predation, germination, and one-year seedling survival were assessed for naturally dispersed seeds and for seeds placed at randomly located sites. Seed predation during the first 12 mo after dispersal was extremely high (99.7%). At least 50% of seed removal was attributable to small rodents, such as Peromyscus mexicanus, with no evidence of scatter-hoarding or secondary dispersal. Seeds dispersed >20 m from parent trees were removed more slowly than seeds directly under the crown, but over the course of the fruiting season seed predation approached 100%, throughout the study site. Seed predation did not differ between gaps and forest understory. Germination of seeds protected from mammals was high (70-90%), regardless of microhabitat or seed size. Seeds regurgitated by birds and seeds removed from fruits by hand germinated equally well (98%), but seeds in intact fruits did not germinate. Seeds defecated by guans and regurgitated by other species in the field had similar germination success. Thus, dispersal by birds is important for removal of pulp but does not otherwise affect germination. Seedlings were taller in gaps (<90% canopy cover) than in closed-canopy forest (>90% cover). Fungal pathogens killed fewer seedlings in gaps than in understory, while other causes of seedling mortality were similar among microhabitats. Consequently, bellbirds, the most likely species to disperse seeds to gaps, had a disproportionate influence on seedling recruitment. Nevertheless, the absolute number of seedlings was higher in closed canopy forest, because the great majority of seeds (85%) landed there. The overall pattern of recruitment, averaged among trees, had a large peak corresponding with bellbird song perches in gaps, as well as a smaller peak near the parent tree corresponding with the seeds dispersed by other species. The relative height of these peaks is opposite that of the original pattern of dispersal. Frugivorous birds that use habitual perches may have disproportionate effects on plant recruitment. To test this idea further, it is necessary to study each stage of the recruitment process, including seed dispersal, postdispersal seed survival, and seedling survival.";"Aulacorhynchus prasinus; birds, seed dispersal; Chamaepetes unicolor; Neotropical cloud forest in Costa Rica; Ocotea endresiana (Lauraceae); Pharomachrus mocinno; Procnias tricarunculata; recruitment; rodents, seed predation; seed dispersal and predation; seedling survival; Turdus plebejus";2000;"ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS";"Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

In this study, we examined the sex-related differences in the roles of late winter pairing activity and seasonal influences on neuroendocrine and reproductive physiology in both male and female mallards. Our main goals were to determine (1) which physiological responses were influenced by pairing status or by seasonal changes and (2) whether responses differed between the sexes. Thus, physiological responses of mallards in different pairing status categories were assessed at two times: January 28 to February 5 and February 24 to March 3. Ducks were assigned to one of the following pairing status categories: strong pairs, temporary pairs, unpaired or lone birds within the flock, or birds isolated in same-sex groups. Seasonal changes correlated with increases in both gonadal mass and hypothalamic content of vasoactive intestinal peptide in both sexes, whereas only pairing status correlated with changes in body mass in both sexes. The main sex-related differences were the following: (1) Seasonal decreases in hypothalamic gonadotrophin releasing hormone II content occurred only in females. (2) Seasonal. increases in serum prolactin occurred only in males, whereas levels in females were low throughout the study. (3) Both male and female gonadal masses increased seasonally, but male gonadal mass was initially mice that of females. (4) Body mass of both sexes was influenced by pairing status correlations (i.e., all paired or lone birds were heavier than isolated birds), but body mass in males decreased seasonally No sex-related differences occurred in hypothalamic gonadotrophin releasing hormone I content or circulating serum luteinizing hormone. Taken together, these results indicate that seasonal reproduction in mallards is regulated not only by seasonal but also by social cues, and differences occur between the sexes, months in advance of actual breeding.

We assessed the impact of predation by hen harriers and peregrine falcons on a red grouse population in southern Scotland during 1992-98. Grouse density in April, July and October declined during this time, coincident with an increase in the numbers of breeding harriers and peregrines. 2. Winter losses of grouse between October and April averaged 33% and were density-dependent. Raptors were the cause of about 70% of winter mortality and they killed about 30% of the grouse present in October. We were unable to determine whether winter mortality in raptors was additive to other losses. 3. Summer losses of adult grouse between April and July averaged 30% and were density-dependent. Raptors were the cause of more than 90% of the early summer mortality of adult grouse. Summer losses of grouse chicks between May and July averaged 45% and were not density-dependent. Harriers killed about 28% of grouse chicks by late July and about 37% by the end of August. Summer raptor predation on adult grouse and chicks appeared to be largely additive to other losses and we estimated that it reduced autumn grouse densities by about 50%. 4. A model combining the estimated reduction in autumn grouse density caused by raptors with the observed density dependence in winter loss predicted that, in the absence of raptors for 2 years, grouse density in spring would be 1.9 times greater, and grouse density in autumn 3.9 times greater, than in the presence of raptors. The model suggested that raptor predation prevented the grouse population from increasing and was thus a limiting factor.";"hen harrier; peregrine falcon; population limitation; predation; red grouse";2000;"JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Two experiments were performed. Experiment I examined whether varying the wavelength and intensity of first (entraining, E) and/or second (inducing, I) light pulse will alter the effects of a skeleton photoperiod. Birds were subjected for a period of 6 weeks to skeleton photoschedules (6L:5D:1L:12D; 6 h E-light pulse, 1 h I-light pulse) containing either an E-pulse at 5 or 20 1x coupled with I-pulse at 100 1x, or an E-pulse at 100 1x, coupled with I-pulse at 5- or 20-1x intensity. Additional two groups that received both E- and I-pulses at 100 1x served as controls. All photoschedules were employed in two colors-white and red (654 nm). There was the wavelength- and intensity-dependent stimulation of the testis growth and development. Long wavelengths of light (red light) induced faster and greater gonadal response, but the effects were also intensity dependent. Experiment II tested whether in the photostimulated birds held on long photoperiods the change in wavelength and intensity of light hours in the morning (entraining period) or the evening (inducing period) will influence the maintenance of the photoperiodic sensitivity. Birds were subjected initially to a long photoperiod of 14L:10D (L = similar to 500 1x; D = 0 1x) and then after 3 weeks, a 4-h light period in the morning (zeitgeber time, zt, 0-4) or in the evening (zt 10-14) of 14 L was substituted with white, green (528 nm), or red (654 nm) light at similar to 20-1x intensity. One group maintained on 14L:10D and other exposed to 10L:14D served as controls. After another 7 weeks, all birds were subjected to 16L:8D for a further 4 weeks to test for their responsivity to long-day photostimulation as a consequence of exposure to different experimental photoperiods. Testes regrew under 16L:8D only in birds that were exposed to 10L:14D or to 14L:10D with a green light pulse. However, there was no effect of the timing (morning, evening) of the light pulse. Taken together, the results from both the experiments indicate that in the redheaded bunting (1) the photoperiodic clock responds differentially to different wavelengths (colors, spectra) and intensities of light, and (2) the effects of wavelength and intensity of light on the clock are phase dependent, and such phasic effects can be seen in skeleton photoperiods in which light is applied discretely at different circadian phases.

Restraint in a metal crush cage for 5 min elicited immobility and silence in all the birds. Circulating C levels were considerably higher in quail of both lines following restraint than in the undisturbed controls of either line. As expected, both the behavioral and physiological effects were more pronounced in HS than in LS birds. Struggling increased with repeated restraint in HS and LS quail, thus suggesting behavioral habituation to the stressor in both lines. On the other hand, a line effect on the pattern of adrenocortical responses was revealed upon subtracting the change in plasma C concentrations from Day 1 to Day 4 in the undisturbed controls from the corresponding change in restrained birds. Thus, unlike LS quail, in which there were no detectable effects of repeated restraint, the adrenocortical responses of HS birds showed evidence of experience-dependent sensitization. Our results demonstrate the importance of the background genome in determining the patterns of the behavioral and adrenocortical responses elicited by repeated exposure to stressful stimulation. The present results and those of previous studies could be explained in one or both of two ways: that underlying fearfulness is lower in LS than HS quail or that they adopt active or passive coping strategies, respectively. Our findings may also have important implications for poultry welfare and productivity. @ 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

This decline has coincided with reductions in the area of suitable habitat and recoveries in the populations of some avian predators. Here we use long-term records of shooting bags and a large-scale manipulation of raptor density to disentangle the effects of habitat loss and raptor predation on grouse populations. The numbers of grouse harvested on the Eskdale half of Langholm Moor in southern Scotland declined significantly during 1913-1990 and grouse bags from the whole moor from 1950 to 1990 exhibited an almost identical but non-significant trend. Hen harriers (Circus cyaneus) and peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) were absent or bred at low densities on this moor throughout this period but heather-dominant vegetation declined by 48% between 1948 and 1988. Harrier and peregrine breeding numbers on Langholm Moor increased to high levels following protection in 1990 whilst grouse density and grouse bags declined year after year until shooting was abandoned in 1998. The prediction of a peak in grouse bags on Langholm Moor in 1996 based on the patterns of bags during 1950-1990 was supported by the observed peaks in 1997 on two nearby moors with few raptors which formerly cycled in synchrony with Langholm Moor. This study demonstrates that, whilst long-term declines in grouse bags were most probably due to habitat loss, high levels of raptor predation subsequently limited the grouse population and suppressed a cycle. This study thus offers support to theoretical models which predict that generalist predators may suppress cycles in prey populations.";"habitat loss; predation; raptors; red grouse";2000;"PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES";"Biology; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

No access or late access to perches during rearing has been shown to increase the later prevalence of floor eggs and cloacal cannibalism in loose-housed laying hens. This may be explained by either the birds reared without perches have difficulty using perches due to low muscle strength, lack of motor skills, and inability to keep balance, or they have impaired spatial skills necessary for moving around in three-dimensional space. These alternative explanations are not mutually exclusive. Thirty, day-old chicks were randomly allocated into two equal groups and reared in litter pens, one with access to perches (P +) and one without (P -). At 8 weeks of age, all birds were given access to perches, and by 15 weeks, all birds were using perches for roosting at night. At 16 weeks, 10 birds from each group were tested in pens where food was presented on a wire mesh tier 40 cm above the ground (T40). Three consecutive tests, with increasing difficulty for the bird to reach the food, were then performed. Firstly, the food was presented at 80 cm above the ground but with the tier at 40 cm still present; secondly, food was presented on the tier at 80 cm; and then, finally, with the food on a 160 cm high tier with the tier at 80 cm still present. All birds were food deprived for 15 h before each test and the time from the bird entering the pen until reaching the food was recorded. There was no difference in the time to reach the food between P + and P- birds in the T40 test. But as the difficulty of the task increased, the difference between the P + and P - birds became significant, with the P - birds taking a longer time to reach the food or not reaching it at all. Since there was no difference between P + and P - in the T40 test, it seems reasonable to suppose that the later differences did not depend on differences in physical ability. Therefore, the results may imply that rearing without early access to perches, in some ways, impairs the spatial cognitive skills of the domestic hen. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The densities of the main prey species, European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa), wood pigeon (Columba palumbus), and rock dove (Columba livia), representing 90.2% of the biomass, were analysed in 19 territories occupied by pairs of Bonelli's eagles and 15 potential territories that were unoccupied but appropriate for nesting. We found no significant differences in prey density between the two types of territories. Contrary to other raptor species, we found no significant relationship between the density of their main prey species and the distance of the neighbouring pairs, either between that density and breeding success. These findings, together with the prior knowledge of nest-site selection of this eagle in the study area, can be used for proper planning of conservation strategies. These should avoid unnecessary effort to increase the eagle's food supply, and should promote the reintroduction of individuals to suitable sites for Bonelli's eagle. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Following capture, demographic data collection, and radio-collaring, they were released into agricultural habitats near Meridian and Nicolaus, CA. After 7 days of acclimation, habitat use and mortality of radio-collared birds were monitored daily using radio-telemetry with Global Positioning Satellites units to record their locations. Randomly selected Meridian alfalfa fields (approximate to 160 acres) were treated with 2% zinc phosphide (Zn3P2) on steamed rolled oat (SRO) baits for vole control. whereas, Nicolaus alfalfa fields (approximate to 160 acres) were treated with placebo baits. After approximate to 5 weeks of radio-tracking during September and October 1996, no pheasants were killed as a result of the Zn3P2 baiting.

It does, indeed, frequently occur when about 90 % of the incubation period has elapsed, shortly before the embryo cracks the eggshell with its bill (External Pipping, EP). In some bird species (e. g. pigeons, shearwaters, petrels, gulls and terns) EP is reported to precede IP. However, in the Rock Dove (Columba livia) and the Diamond Dove (Geopelia cuneata) we could not confirm this observation. In many papers IP is said normally to be especially correlated with a change in embryonic oxygen consumption, namely a transition to a plateau phase. At this time respiration changes from chorioallantoic membrane to lungs; the lungs are filled with air which is thought to be provided exclusively from the air-cell. Many authors describe this behaviour accordingly. Nevertheless, there exist no direct observations or even experimental data to substantiate this claim. Our paper deals with this problem: During our long-term experiments on embryonic metabolic rate we first observed that embryos of at least 17 different bird species frequently hatched and developed successfully without any signs of a general IP. The membrane of the air-cell was not pipped (see Table 1). Additional and systematic observations in a professional breeding station on 1040 eggs of Gallus gallus domesticus showed that in 7-13,5 % of cases embryos hatched without any signs of IP (see Table 2). To determine whether this phenomenon is a common event we performed special experiments in four different bird species (Domestic Fowl Gallus gallus domesticus, Rock Dove, Common Quail Coturnix coturnix, Brown Kiwi Apteryx mantelli). These test showed that hatching without IP occurs in 7 to 65 % (mean value 35.7 %) of cases in all four species without any negative effects on subsequent ontogenetic development. Evidently, IP is not an obligatory but a facultative behaviour in these cases, and probably in general. The aeration of the lungs can be done a different way within the space of the chorioallantoic membrane; for this reason no air-cell is needed.";"Internal Pipping; hatching behaviour; air-cell; Apteryx mantelli; ontogeny of breathing";2000;"JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Mean values for the quantity of low screening cover (<50 cm aboveground), operative temperature (degrees C), and exposure to aerial predators were relatively constant across regions (CV <14.2%), indicating these variables are important in adaptive habitat-use decisions by bobwhites. Bobwhites exhibited preference in all regions for higher canopy coverage of woody vegetation, lower exposure to aerial predators, and lower operative temperatures in comparison with randomly available conditions. The major habitat deficiencies for masked bobwhites were lack of woody and herbaceous cover, which led to high exposure to aerial predators in Sonora and Arizona.

In most survival studies, researchers have made these assumptions without testing their validity. We tested these assumptions by comparing interannual recapture rates (and, by inference, survival) between radioed and unradioed adult female harlequin ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus), and for radioed females, between right-censored birds (i.e., those for which the radio signal was lost during the telemetry monitoring period) and birds with known fates. We found that recapture rates of birds equipped with implanted radiotransmitters (21.6 +/- 3.0%; (x) over bar +/- SE) were similar to unradioed birds (21.7 +/- 8.6%), suggesting that radios did not affect survival. Recapture rates also were similar between right-censored (20.6 +/- 5.1%) and known-fate individuals (22.1 +/- 3.8%), suggesting that missing birds were not subject to differential mortality. We also determined that capture and handling resulted in short-term loss of body mass for both radioed and unradioed females and that this effect was more pronounced for radioed birds (the difference between groups was 15.4 +/- 7.1 g). However, no difference existed in body mass after recapture 1 year later.

Social housing and domestic chicks' responses to symbolic video images. Appl. Anim. Behav. Sci. 56, 231-243; Jones, R.B., Larkins, C., Hughes, B.O., 1996. Approach/avoidance responses of domestic chicks to familiar and unfamiliar video images of biologically neutral stimuli. Appl. Anim. Behav. Sci. 48, 81-98]. The potential existence of an adult parallel was examined here by studying the responses of laying hens to similar screensaver videos when these were presented repeatedly in front of their home cage. In Experiment 1, individually housed, 31-week-old laying hens were exposed to either the video image of a computer screensaver (SS) programme (Fish), a blank but illuminated television monitor (B), or a black plastic hide (H) presented approximately 50 cm in front of their home cages for 10 min/day on each of 5 consecutive days. The bird's position in the cage and the orientation of its head were recorded every 15 s during the-l0 min exposure period in order to assess approach and interest, respectively. Interest was scored by summing the numbers of observations at which the hen was either facing the front or had its head out of the cage. Birds in the B and H treatment groups showed few deviations from neutrality in their approach or interest. Conversely, although SS birds avoided the video stimulus on the first day their responses had reached neutrality (neither approach nor avoidance) by the third day and they showed significantly more approach than would be expected by chance at the fifth presentation. They also showed significantly more interest than chance on each test day; this score increased progressively and showed no sign of waning even at the fifth presentation. To determine whether or not such interest would be maintained indefinitely, the responses of previously untested hens were examined when the same video (Fish) was presented for 10 min/day on each of 20 consecutive days (Experiment 2). A blank, lit television (B) was again used a control. An unfamiliar video (Doodles) was presented to the SS birds on day 21 to determine the effects of stimulus change. After avoiding the stimuli upon their first presentation, both SS and B birds achieved neutrality by day 3. Approach scores then fell in B birds but rarely deviated from neutrality in SS ones. The SS video attracted markedly more interest than did the blank screen. On this occasion, SS hens showed significantly greater interest than would be expected by chance as early as the third presentation and this was still evident upon the eighth presentation; thereafter it waned gradually. However, interest was reinstated fully when the unfamiliar SS image was shown on day 21. The present findings clearly demonstrate that abstract video images, presented in front of the home cage for 10 min on consecutive days, reliably attracted and sustained the interest of individually housed laying hens for as long as 8 days. These results an consistent with those obtained when chicks were repeatedly exposed to similar screensaver videos, i.e., this phenomenon is not dependent on the stage of development. Our results also confirm the importance of considering the environment outside as well as inside the cage in future environmental enrichment programmes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

In order to investigate this relationship, the learning abilities of Japanese quail chicks from lines that have been divergently selected for high or low levels of underlying fearfulness, as measured by the duration of tonic immobility behaviour, were compared. Day-old chicks from both lines were trained in a one-trial passive avoidance task. In this task, young chicks spontaneously peck at a small, visually conspicuous bead. If the bead has been coated with a gustatory aversant, the chicks learn in a single trial not to peck a similar, uncoated bead upon subsequent presentation. Significantly more chicks of the low fear line pecked the training bead compared to those of the high fear line. However, 2 h later, chicks of both lines trained on a methyl anthranilate-coated bead showed similar avoidance of the test bead. Therefore, although fear affected performance during training, it did not appear to directly affect memory formation in this task. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Placodes were reconstructed from camera lucida drawings of serial sections, and the spatiotemporal pattern of placodal neurogenesis was analyzed using in situ hybridization for the genes X-NGNR-1,XNeuroD, X-MyT1, and X-Delta-1, all of which have been implicated in the regulation of neurogenesis. Olfactory, profundal, and trigeminal placodes, a series of dorsolateral placodes (otic placode and five lateral line placodes), a series of epibranchial placodes, and two hypobranchial placodes were identified. Earlier claims that all placodes in anurans develop from a common primordium could not be confirmed. Profundal and trigeminal placodes, however, are partially fused, and all lateral line placodes arise from a common precursor. Epibranchial and hypobranchial placodes develop ventral to other placodes and dorsal and ventral to the pharyngeal pouches, respectively. Hypobranchial placodes give rise to neurons that become intimately associated with the developing heart. All neurogenic placodes strongly express the neuronal differentiation gene XNeuroD. The neuronal determination gene X-NGNR-1, however, is expressed strongly in only some placodes and not in dorsolateral placodes, indicating that neurogenesis in the latter relies on other determination genes. X-Delta-1 is expressed not only in the neurogenic parts of the placodes but also in the primordia of the lateral lines. This suggests that Delta-Notch-mediated lateral inhibition may be involved not only in placodal neurogenesis, but also in the patterning of lateral line neuromasts.

Attention is currently focused on whether females choose males on the basis of their genetic quality, in order to produce more viable offspring(1). Support for this hypothesis in birds has come from studies showing that preferred males tend to father offspring of better condition or with increased survivorship(2-8). Before attributing greater offspring viability to a male's heritable genetic quality, however, it is important: to discount effects arising from confounding sources, including maternal effects. This has generally been addressed by comparing offspring viability from two different breeding attempts by the same female: one when offspring; are sired by a preferred male, and one when offspring are sired by a less preferred male, However, here we show that individual female mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) lay larger eggs after copulating: with preferred males and smaller eggs after copulating with less preferred males. As a result, females produced offspring of better body condition when paired with preferred males. After controlling: for these differences in maternal investment, we found no effect: of paternity on offspring condition.

Hen Harriers foraged preferentially over young first rotation coniferous forests, and selected healthland and grassland habitats ahead of closed canopy woodland. Harrier preference for the various habitats was positively correlated with the frequency with which they struck at and captured, prey. Prey strike success was much lower than that reported for moorland managed for Red Grouse Lagapus lagopus scoticus. The results explain many of the reported changes in local Hen Harrier populations.

Habitat fragments surrounded by nonhabitat coniferous forest, in an intensively managed forested landscape, were censused during seven seasons. None of the 33 habitat fragments were occupied in all seven seasons and 7 were never occupied. Turnover occurred in 79% of the habitat fragments. The most common occupation of a habitat fragment was by only one hazel grouse male (84%). Thus, the dynamics of hazel grouse occurrence in the habitat fragments was basically monitored on the scale of individuals. Large and less isolated habitat fragments with a high amount of cover were occupied significantly more often than small, isolated fragments. The effect of size appeared most clearly when analyzing the total number of hazel grouse occupying a habitat fragment. The appearance of hazel grouse in the habitat fragments was best explained by the amount of cover, distance to the nearest suitable habitat, and size of the habitat fragment. The effects of interfragment distance on the occurrence and appearance of hazel grouse implies that the habitat has become functionally disconnected for hazel grouse and suggests that the amount of suitable hazel grouse habitat left in this landscape has fallen below a critical level.";NA;2000;"CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE";"Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Under LSA, we specify plausible or hypothesized levels of uncertainty, variation, and covariation in vital rates fur a given population. We use these data under resampling simulations to establish random combinations of vital rates for a large number of matrix replicates and finally summarize results from the matrix replicates to estimate potential effects of each vital rate on lambda in a probability-based context. Estimates of potential effects are based on a variety of summary statistics, such as frequency of replicates having the same vital rate of highest elasticity, difference in elasticity values calculated under simulated conditions vs, elasticities calculated using mean invariant vital rates, percentage of replicates having positive population growth, and variation in lambda explained by variation in each vital rate. To illustrate, we applied LSA to viral rates for two vertebrates: desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) and Greater prairie Chicken (Tympanuchus cupido). Results fur the prairie chicken indicated that a single vital rate consistently had greatest effect on population growth. Results for desert tortoise, however, suggested that a variety of life stages could have strong effects on population growth. Additional simulations for the Greater Prairie Chicken under a hypothetical conservation plan also demonstrated that a variety of vital rates could be manipulated to achieve desired population growth. To improve the reliability of inference, we recommend that potential effects of vital rates on lambda be evaluated using a probability-based approach like LSA. LSA is an important complement to other methods that evaluate vital-rate effects on lambda, including classical elasticity analysis, retrospective methods of variance decomposition, and simulation of the effects of environmental stochasticity.";"demography; Gopherus agassizii (desert tortoise); elasticity; finite rate of increase; life-stage simulation analysis and importance; matrix population models; population growth; sensitivity; species conservation; Tympanuchus cupido (Greater Prairie Chicken); variance and covariance; vital rates";2000;"ECOLOGY";"Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

LH secretion showed a dampened pattern in the three species, particularly in tropicbirds. Such specific differences may be related to the less elaborate courtship displays in tropicbirds. Testosterone levels were very low throughout breeding in all three species, particularly in boobies. Low testosterone values in boobies may be related to their year-round attendance at the colony. Prolactin secretion increased from the prelaying period until the incubation and brooding periods and declined thereafter in boobies but stayed relatively unchanged throughout the breeding cycle in tropicbirds. The relatively constant prolactin secretion in the more pelagic tropicbirds might allow them to undertake parental care despite long absences at sea. Boobies perform postfledging care with basal prolactin levels. For all species, females always have higher prolactin levels than males. This hormonal dimorphism, being more pronounced in boobies, may be associated with differences in parental care between mates.

As a result, zebra finches have traditionally been considered nonphotoperiodic. Despite this, there are some published reports of photoperiodic effects on behavior in zebra finches. Therefore, we transferred singly housed male zebra finches from a photoperiod of 14 h light and 10 h dark per day (14L:10D) to either 20L:4D or 8L:16D. Control birds remained exposed to 14L:10D. Plasma LH, testicular volume, and body mass were assessed at the start of the experiment and at intervals for a period of 56 days. Testicular mass was measured at the end of the 56-day period. Plasma LH increased significantly in the 20L:4D group after 14 days, but decreased again by 56 days, presumably an effect of increased gonadal steroid negative feedback. Plasma LH did not change significantly in the other two groups. Testicular volume increased steadily in the 20L:4D group during the treatment period and it was significantly higher than that of the 8L:16D group at the end of the experiment. After 56 days of treatment, combined testicular mass in the 20L:4D group was much greater than that of the 8L:16D group, but not quite statistically different from the 14L:10D group. There was no statistical difference in testicular mass between the 14L and 8L groups. Body mass did not differ between any of the groups at any time in the experiment. Our results are consistent with zebra finches being photoperiodic to some degree, despite their opportunistic breeding strategy. When considered in conjunction with recent reports of photoperiodic responses in tropical avian species, these data suggest that the ability to respond to changing photoperiod is more common among avian species than previously hypothesized.

The present study determined the instantaneous fH of seven chick embryos continuously from the last stage of prenatal development (day 18), throughout the pipping (perinatal) period (days 19-21) until hatching and, subsequently, of newly hatched chicks (up to day 2), The distinctive patterns of instantaneous fH fluctuations took the form of specific changes within a broad mean fH baseline. Cyclic oscillations (ultradian rhythm) occurred until an early stage of the perinatal period, when the fH baseline started rising, Subsequently, the baseline dropped and respiratory arrhythmia began to appear concomitant with external pipping, During the final stage of external pipping, when the fH baseline rose again prior to hatching, three unique patterns of instantaneous fH fluctuations were evident: relatively long-lasting cyclic small accelerations, irregular intermittent large accelerations and short-term repeated large accelerations. Furthermore, repeated alternate occurrences of the latter two types of acceleration formed an additional oscillating pattern with a period of 10-15 min. During the early period after hatching, when the fH baseline reached its maximum, instantaneous fH changed relatively slowly accompanied by transient rapid decelerations, probably due to augmented vagal tone, Subsequently, the mean fH baseline dropped to its minimum, and a circadian rhythm and three types of previously reported fH fluctuations (types I-III) appeared. Developmental patterns of mean fH and the appearance of distinctive patterns of instantaneous fluctuations in fH and circadian rhythms were not influenced by an ultimate failure of hatching after a normal development. The demonstration of complex, repeatable patterns of fH fluctuation that change during development suggests that the avian embryo model should be useful in studying the phenomenon of fH fluctuation and its underlying causes.";"circadian rhythm; developmental pattern; heart rate fluctuation; instantaneous heart rate; mean heart rate; prenatal embryo; perinatal embryo; postnatal chick; ultradian rhythm; Gallus gallus domesticus";2000;"JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY";"Biology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

On Mbirikani Group Ranch in southern Kenya, two local field assistants were employed by the ranch to provide information on hunting areas in the field, and check adherence to quotas. They were also trained to collect regular data on relative abundance and breeding condition of two focal species, Yellow-necked Spurfowl Francolinus leucoscepus and Helmeted Guineafowl Numida meleagris.

Furthermore, some suggest that higher rates of postembryonic development in birds should reduce peak metabolic rate (PMR) through delayed tissue maturation and/or an increased energy allocation to organ growth. We studied this by comparing metabolic rates and organ sizes of fast-growing meat-type chickens (broilers) with those of birds from a laying strain, which grow much slower. During the first week of life, despite growing six times faster, the RMR of the broiler chickens was lower than that of birds of the laying strain. The difference between strains in RMR disappeared thereafter, even though broilers continued to grow twice as fast as layers. The differences between strains in growth rate during the first week after hatching were not reflected in similar differences in the relative masses of the heart, liver, and small intestine. However, broilers had heavier intestines once they reached a body mass of 80 g. In contrast, broilers had relatively smaller brains than did layers. There was a positive correlation, over both strains, between RMR and the masses of leg muscles, intestine, and liver. Furthermore, despite delayed maturation of muscle tissue, broilers exhibited significantly higher PMR.

From the mast depression hypothesis, it was predicted that the number of capercaillies counted at leks and the mean clutch size should be high after high seed crops (masts) of bilberry, usually produced at intervals of 3-5 years. In stepwise regression models, both the bilberry index of the preceding year and the autumn population index one (hens) or two (cocks) years earlier contributed to explain the mean number of capercaillies counted at leks during 1970-1978. Capercaillie clutch sizes were highest in years with early thaw, but the effect was significant only for the period 1969-1978. For this period, there also was a positive effect of the bilberry index and a negative effect of the autumn population index of the previous year.

In Experiment 1, socially housed chicks were either exposed daily from 2 to 8 days of age to the video image of a computer screensaver (SS) in their home cage, or not (N). At 9, 10 or Il days of age each chick was tested individually in a square, black open field with either the SS video or just a sheet of black card (control, BC) visible through a wire-mesh window in one of the walls. SS chicks approached the familiar video image sooner and spent longer near it than N ones. These findings are consistent with earlier reports that familiar SS images were attractive to domestic chicks in a two-choice runway test and they show that this phenomenon generalizes to include a one-choice open-field situation. Our observations that SS chicks also walked significantly more and tended to vocalize sooner than N ones regardless of the test situation suggested that previous video stimulation may have reduced their fear of this novel environment.

All chicks were then tested individually in a uniformly black open field with no video present. Freezing was shown by fewer CV than C chicks. The CV chicks also showed shorter durations of freezing, they entered more areas of the open field and tended to vocalize sooner than those from the C group. These results support the suggestion that regular exposure to a complex CV image during the first week of life decreased chicks' fear when they were subsequently placed in an unfamiliar environment.

To examine these associations under natural conditions, we monitored 3 populations of prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) for temporal variations in selected immunological parameters, population density, and survival rate from winter 1996 to spring 1997. Spontaneous and cytokine-stimulated T-cell proliferative responsiveness of prairie voles peaked in winter and declined in spring. Relative organ mass, hemolytic-complement activity, and in vivo hypersensitivity responses varied temporally but showed no clear seasonal trend. The population density and survival rate of all 3 prairie vole populations varied temporally and correlated with measures of immunity. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the model containing relative spleen mass, cytokine-stimulated T-cell proliferation, and in vivo hypersensitivity explained a significant amount of variability in population density, while cytokine-stimulated T-cell proliferation and relative thymus mass explained a significant amount of variability in survival rate.

We address this issue by examining the conflict between raptor conservation and management of Red Grouse (Lagopus l. scoticus) in Britain. Heather moorland is a distinctive habitat that supports an important assemblage of breeding birds. Large areas of moorland are managed by private landowners for shooting grouse. Although grouse shooting benefits conservation by retaining heather moorland, it is currently unclear whether grouse management directly benefits other upland birds. Human persecution has greatly restricted the range and abundance of most raptor species in Britain. Following the introduction of bird protection laws, the decline in gamekeeping, and the restriction of organochlorine pesticides, raptor populations have started to recover. Persecution of raptors on grouse moors is widespread and limits the range and abundance of Hen Harriers (Circus cyaneus), Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus) and Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos). In some circumstances, raptor predation can reduce both the breeding density and productivity of Red Grouse. Limitation of grouse populations through raptor predation is most likely to occur where raptors are at high density because of the abundance of alternative prey, and grouse are at low density either because of poor management or the cyclic nature of some grouse populations. In the long term, habitat management may reduce densities of alternative prey, leading to reductions in raptor densities and their predation on grouse. More active intervention may be required, however, if grouse moors are to remain viable in the short-term. Current research is focused on manipulating harrier diet through diversionary feeding. Complementary research is needed to investigate methods to reduce raptor numbers locally while ensuring their national status.";NA;2000;"CONSERVATION BIOLOGY";"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Crown-fires created large open patches that persisted on the droughty soils, providing important habitat for a number of area-sensitive, open-habitat species. Insect outbreaks may have contributed to periodic fires by increasing the fuel load. Today, fires are suppressed in the managed landscape, but insect defoliation remains a major disturbance. Salvage logging commonly follows insect outbreaks. Our objective was to evaluate landscape pattern changes caused by this interaction of natural disturbances and forest management. We examined changes in landscape pattern during the most recent (1990-1995) outbreak of jack pine budworm (Choristoneura pinus pinus) in northwestern Wisconsin using four Landsat TM satellite images (1987, 1991, 1993, and 1995). The 1987 image provided the basis for a species-level forest classification identifying mature jack pine and open habitat prior to the budworm outbreak. Each subsequent image was used to identify clearcuts in mature jack pine. The 1995 image was also used to classify stand development in the open habitat of the 1987 image so that the overall availability of open habitat in 1995 could be assessed. GIS data layers were used to analyze logging rates and clearcut sizes separately for different classes of land ownership and soils. Approximately 12 500 ha were salvage logged during the 1990-1995 outbreak. Logging rates were highest on the most infertile soils, and on private, industrial forest land. Annual logging rates of different landowners were 3-6 times higher during the outbreak than previous to it. Salvage cut sizes were larger than clearcuts prior to the outbreak. New cuts were mostly located next to previous cuts, thus increasing the size of openings on the landscape. Initial survey results by N. Niemuth show that populations of one area-sensitive open-habitat species (Sharp-tailed Grouse, Tympanuchus phasianellus) thrive on the salvage cuts. Insect defoliation and subsequent salvage logging did create new habitat for open-habitat species that were declining. Landscape pattern changes due to multiple interacting disturbances have rarely been studied. The interaction of jack pine budworm defoliation and salvage logging substantially changed landscape pattern in the Pine Barrens. We speculate that interaction between insect defoliation and fire may have significantly shaped the presettlement landscape.";"change detection; clearcut size; fire disturbance; forest; insect defoliation; jack pine budworm (Choristoneura pinus pinus); landscape ecology; pine barrens; Pinus banksiana; remote sensing; salvage logging; spatial pattern; Wisconsin (USA)";2000;"ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS";"Ecology; Environmental Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Ten haplotypes were resolved, several of which were shared among populations. Analysis of molecular variance, Nei's gamma(ST), and a cladistic estimate of the amount of gene flow indicated a lack of overall population differentiation. Patterns of overall panmixia are in stark contrast to previous reports of localized subdivision among the same set of populations detected using hypervariable microsatellite markers. Because grouse cocks are territorial and show extreme natal philopatry and females are the dispersing sex, such discordance could be explained by sex-biased dispersal, with extensive female-mediated gene flow preventing mitochondrial DNA divergence. However, it is difficult to reconcile how effective dispersal of females would not homogenize both mitochondrial and nuclear structure simultaneously. We use a model that examines the spatial and temporal dynamics of diparentally and uniparentally inherited genes to show that, under realistic ecological scenarios and with specitic differences in the dispersal of males and females, the local effective size of the nuclear genome can be less than that of the mitochondrial and the patterns of structuring we observe are meaningful.";"gene flow; grouse; Lagopus; mitochondrial DNA; philopatry; population structure";2000;"EVOLUTION";"Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

It is not clear whether tests suitable for hazard assessment in mammals also apply to oviparous (egg-laying) animals, or vice versa. Although estrogenic structures are similar across species, estrogen receptor (ER) differences affecting binding affinity and gene activation do occur. The primary function of estrogen in all species is control of ovulation; secondary functions are gender determination, development of secondary sex characteristics, regulation of mating and breeding behaviors, and regulation of calcium and water homeostasis. Major differences between mammals and egg-layers are production of the egg yolk protein vitellogenin by the Liver of oviparous species and eggshell formation. Methods for measuring estrogenic activity include production of gene products, cell proliferation assays, tissue responses, vitellogenin induction, hormone assays, egg production and fertility studies, and development of secondary sex characteristics. General cellular/subcellular tests are proposed for initial chemical screening; those that show estrogenic effects would be tested further using species-specific in vitro assays (e.g., relative binding affinity to the ER).

Global positioning systems (GPS) were used to track hunters in an area of central Norway where willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus were contemporaneously radio-tracked. A geographical information system (GIS) was then used to study spatiotemporal interactions between hunters and game. 2. Recording hunting activity with the GPS produced accurate and unbiased information about the behaviour and effort of hunters. When GPS tracking nine hunters during 50 hunter-days, data were lost for an estimated time of 30 h 45 min, which constituted about 10% of the total hunting time. 3. Willow ptarmigan hunters walked on average 16.2 km daily at a speed of 2.8 km h(-1), and they hunted for 9 h each day, of which almost 6 h was active hunting time. During 50 hunter-days they had 295 h of active hunting, covered a distance of 818 km and harvested 20% of the willow ptarmigan population in the area. 4. The spatial distribution of hunting pressure was strongly dependent on the starting point of the hunters, and areas close to the base cabin were subject to most hunting activity. Areas furthest away, towards the border of the hunting area, experienced little hunting activity. 5. Logistic regression showed that survival probability of ptarmigan was best predicted by distance from the cabin. Shot radio-tagged birds lived closer to the cabin, and had twice as high hunting pressure in their home range, compared with surviving radio-tagged birds. 6.

In the tectorotundal system, neurons of the stratum griseum centrale (SGC) of the optic tectum send their axons bilaterally to the nucleus rotundus (Rt). In transit to the Rt, the axons of the SGC neurons collateralize in the nuclei posteroventralis thalami (PV), subpretectalis (SP), and interstitiopretectosubpretectalis (IPS) of the tectothalamic tract (TT). The current study used birthdating and pathway-tracing methods to investigate the neurogenesis and time course of neuronal connections of the tectorotundal pathway in chicks during embryogenesis. By using tritiated thymidine autoradiography, we observed that the SGC neurons of the tectum were generated by embryonic days 3.0-5.5 (E3.0-E5.5), the Rt by E3.5-E5.0, and the nuclei of TT by E3.5-4.5. To trace the tectorotundal pathway, we injected cholera toxin B subunit (CTb) into the tectum, and the CTb-like immunoreactivity was examined. By E4.5-E5.5, some CTb-like immunoreactive (CTb-LI) axons terminated in the ipsilateral SP/IPS. By E6.0-E6.5, CTb-LI axon bundles were seen ipsilaterally in the TT. Increased numbers of labeled axons were seen terminating in the SP/IPS. By E7.0-E7.5, heavily labeled axons in the TT were observed with diffuse terminals in areas ventral to the presumptive Rt and PV. By E7.5-E8.0, the tectal axons innervated the ipsilateral Rt, in which some of the collaterals crossed the midline to the contralateral diencephalon. The crossed tectorotundal projection was seen first by E8.0-E8.5. Also, during this stage, a few CTb-LI collaterals terminated in the contralateral SP/IPS. Between E10 and. E13, the pattern of bilateral tectorotundal projections became more regionalized, whereas labeling continued to increase in the SP/IPS. At E16, the labeling pattern of all tectorecipient structures resembled that of the hatchling. The current study revealed the temporal order of development of the tectorotundal pathway during embryogenesis. The SGC cells first innervate ipsilaterally the SP/IPS and then the Rt/PV. The schedule of the crossed tectorotundal connections coincides with the schedule of tectal projections onto the contralateral intrinsic nuclei of the TT. We conclude that E8.0 (+/-E0.5) is a critical stage for the development of the tectofugal pathway. Moreover, the current study provides important insights into the relative ontogeny of the mammalian tectofugal pathway. J. Comp. Neurol. 417:115-132, 2000.

In an initial group this was done using eggs extracted from the uterus before oviposition. The development of germ discs after incubation in ovo (obliquely positioned or not) was compared with development after culture in vitro: germ discs develop much better when incubated in ovo than when cultured in vitro. We previously demonstrated that in obliquely-oriented germ discs, localized in situ on their egg yolk ball, the nucleus of PANDER and surrounding subgerminal ooplasmic layers present a spatial orientation parallel with RAUBER's sickle and with the temporally-predisposed sickle-shaped Anlage fields in the upper layer of the unincubated overlying blastoderm. The observations in our present study suggest that at the moment of bilateral symmetrization, a ""vertical"" influence emanating from the central subgerminal ooplasmic layers on parallel parts of the overlying blastoderm takes place. The first sign of the development of bilateral symmetry (already seen on the surface of a germ disc after 4 h of oblique positioning) is the appearance of a broad antisickle in the future cranial half of the blastodisc. In a second group, by excision of parts of unincubated or incubated blastoderms, followed by culture in vitro, we tried to explain some phenomena occuring during early axis development. Whilst gastrulation phenomena can take place after in vitro culture of isolated cranial quadrants of unincubated chicken blastoderms (stage X-XI of Eyal-Giladi and Kochav: 1976), this is not the case in isolated anti-sickle regions. The actual presence of neither RAUBER'S sickle material nor sickle endoblast is necessary for the formation of a primitive streak. Also the existence of a long-range secretion gradient of inducing factors derived from these structures after their removal can play an inducing role.";"caudocephalic orientation; avian blastoderm; RAUBER'S sickle; gastrulation; anti-sickle region";2000;"BELGIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY";"Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The effect of regional hypoxia on the vascular density of American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) and chicken (Gallus gallus) CAMs was studied to determine if hypoxic proliferation of blood vessels is localized or global across the CAM. Eggs were incubated under normoxic conditions with a portion of the eggshell covered with non-toxic beeswax to induce external regional hypoxia. CAMs were examined under a microscope with a 'bulls eye' coverslip and a vascular density index (VDI) was determined. The hypoxic portions of the alligator CAMs were more vascular than the normoxic portions (VDI = 200.9 versus 157.8, respectively). Presumably this response is maladaptive by causing increased blood flow to the poorly oxygenated portions, i.e. increased 'shunt'. Thus, we hypothesize increased vascularity due to hypoxic incubation is due to local release and subsequent rapid local breakdown or uptake of angiogenic factors. In contrast, the hypoxic and normoxic portions of the chick CAMs exhibited virtually no difference in VDI (VDI = 211.5 versus 217.9, respectively). We suggest the air cell and air space of the chicken eggs allows for circulation of gas in ovo, eliminating the possibility of regional internal hypoxia. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

The analyses were conducted at three spatial scales: Feint-count station (4 ha), block (12.5 km(2)), and landscape unit levels. At the census point scale. temporal variability (CV) of generalist species correlated negatively with amount of unforested habitat. At the block scale, temporal variability of forest edge and managed forest species correlated negatively with the amount of forested area in the landscape. No response was observed among sedentary, migratory, and virgin forest species at these lower scales. At the landscape unit scale. forest-edge and managed-forest species such as chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs L.), and redpoll (Carduelis flammea L.) showed higher temporal variability, whereas sedentary and virgin forest species such as cuckoo (Cuculus canorus L.), raven (Corvus corax L.), and hooded crow (Corvus corone cornix L.) showed lower temporal variability in the moderately fragmented landscape than in the less-fragmented landscape. Of the virgin-forest species, crossbills (Loxia spp.) and titmice (Parus spp.) showed more variability in the less-fragmented landscape, whereas the rest of the virgin-forest species (hawks, grouses, woodpeckers, etc.) reflected more temporal variability in the moderately fragmented landscape unit. The results were only partially in accordance with expected trends, and there were differences between scales in variability patterns of species and species groups.

Dissipation of photorefractoriness and reestablishment of photosensitivity are associated with increased GnRH-li ir brain production, but concurrent changes in VIP-ii ir expression have not been investigated. To address this question, we compared the expression of VIP-ii ir in the infundibulum (INF) of adult male dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) that were made. photorefractory (PR) by prolonged exposure to long days with that of birds that were not photostimulated (PS), but had regained photosensitivity by exposure to short days for 5 (short-term-PS, ST-PS) or 13 (long-term-PS, LT-PS) consecutive months. Photosensitive males had smaller INF VIP-ii ir cell bodies than PR males, but the numbers of INF VIP-ii ir cells were independent of photoperiodic condition. Changes in infundibular VIP-li ir were correlated with changes in preoptic area (POA) GnRH-li expression. Specifically, photosensitive males had more and larger POA GnRH-li ir cells and more GnRH-li ir fibers in this region than PR males. Further, LT-PS males had more GnRH-li ir POA fibers and larger testes than ST-PS juncos. Thus, induction of photorefractoriness is associated with increased VIP and decreased GnRH brain expression whereas dissipation of photorefractoriness concurs with decreased VIP and increased GnRN brain expression. These results suggest a physiological role for VIP in the control of changes in GnRH expression as a function of the photosensitive condition.

However, the role of T in year-round territorial birds is still enigmatic, especially in tropical birds. Spotted antbirds (Hylophylax n. naevioides) defend territories in the Panamanian rainforest year-round but have low plasma T levels (0.1-0.2 ng/ml), except during brief periods of social challenges. We manipulated T action in captive male Spotted antbirds to test whether this hormone is involved in the regulation of song and aggression. T-implants increased plasma androgen levels (T and dihydrotestosterone) and enhanced song in nonbreeding males. During a staged male-male encounter, T-implanted males sang more and were more aggressive than controls. In a second experiment, we blocked the two known T actions: its binding to androgen receptors and its conversion into estradiol by the enzyme aromatase. For this, we administered the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide (Flut) in combination with the aromatase inhibitor 1-4-6 androstatrien-3,17-dione (ATD) to birds in breeding condition. ATD + Flut treatment significantly elevated plasma levels of luteinizing hormone, presumably via the lack of T feedback from its receptors. ATD + Flut-treated birds gave fewer spontaneous songs than control-implanted males. During staged male-male encounters, ATD + Flut-treated males did not sing at all and showed reduced aggressive behavior. Our data indicate that T can regulate aggressive behavior in these tropical birds. Although plasma T levels can be low year-round, Spatted antbirds may use T either by secreting it briefly during social challenges, by having a high sensitivity to T action, or by enzymatically converting circulating T precursors directly at the site of action. We hypothesize that: plasma T levels are kept low in these year-round territorial birds to avoid potentially detrimental effects of tonically elevated T. Future treatment of nonbreeding birds with ATD + Flut will reveal whether T is indeed involved year-round in regulatin aggressive behavior.

Aromatase activity and cells containing the aromatase protein and mRNA have accordingly been identified in the brain areas involved in the control of behavior. The presence of an unusually high level of aromatase activity has been detected in the telencephalon of one songbird species, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), and it is suspected that this high telencephalic aromatase may be a specific feature of songbirds but this idea is supported only by few experimental data. The distribution of aromatase activity in the brain of zebra finches and of one nonsongbird species, the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), was compared with the distribution of aromatase activity in the brain of four species of free-living European songbirds, the chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs, Fringillidae), willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus, Sylviidae), great tit (Pa;rus major, Paridae), and pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca, Muscicapidae), High levels of enzyme activity were observed in the diencephalon of all species. The high levels of aromatase activity that had been observed in the zebra finch telencephalon and were thought to be typical of songbirds were also present in the four wild oscine species but not in quail. None of these songbird species had, however, a telencephalic aromatase activity as high as that in the zebra finch, which may represent an extreme as far as the activity of this enzyme in the telencephalon is concerned. Measurable levels of aromatase activity were also detected in all songbird species in the liver and in the three other brain areas that were assayed, the optic lobes, cerebellum, and brain stem, with the exception of the cerebellum in willow warblers and quail, but no detectable activity was observed in the testes, muscle, and adrenals of all species, Additional studies will be needed to identify the Functional significance of estrogen synthesis in areas that are not classically known to be implicated in the control of reproduction. Within a given species, the birds that had the highest plasma testosterone levels also displayed the highest levels of diencephalic aromatase activity and the interspecies differences in the two variables were positively related. This raises the possibility that the absolute level of diencephalic aromatase represents a species-specific characteristic under the control of plasma testosterone levels. There was, in contrast, no correlation between the aromatase activity in the telencephalon and the plasma testosterone levels but the enzyme activity was-correlated with the plasma levels of luteinizing hormone. These data bring additional support to the idea that the diencephalic and telencephalic aromatases are controlled by independent mechanisms.

Very little has been published about the biology of this species except for Japanese journals and popular articles. Here we outline some unique aspects of the breeding biology of this species as well as introduce endocrine methods as a way of determining the source of reproductive problems in captive breeding programmes and, tentatively, how hormone manipulations based on these observations may help to enhance reproductive output. The Toki has a unique nuptial plumage that is acquired by the cosmetic application of a black tar-like substance secreted by a well-defined patch of skin in the throat and neck region. Apparent specialized down feathers develop in this region during a localized moult in November. The tar-like substance is secreted in January and February and is applied to the head, neck and upper torso by a combination of bathing and daubing behaviour. Development of nuptial colour is thus a combination of morphological development, secretion and a unique behaviour. This combination is found only in adults. Single plasma samples collected from captive Toki at known times in the breeding cycle suggest normal hormone patterns in some individuals, and abnormal levels in those that fail to breed. These conclusions are strengthened by endocrine investigations of a non-endangered ibis species, Threskiornis melanocephalus, that reveal normal patterns of circulating concentrations of gonadotrophins and sex steroids as expected for a seasonally breeding bird. Measurement of faecal hormone levels may be a less invasive way of monitoring reproductive function in critically endangered species. Recent work on Japanese Quail Coturnix japonica shows that hormone therapy using purified avian gonadotrophins in non-reproductive individuals results in gonadal maturation, egg-laying and production of reproductively active offspring. Although these techniques are still in their formative stages, results to date strongly suggest that carefully applied endocrine techniques can indicate potential problems in captive breeding programmes and may be useful for hormone therapy in critically endangered species.";NA;2000;"IBIS";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

A similar neointima can be induced by a balloon-catheter-induced endothelium injury to the fowl aorta. Both spontaneously developed and injury-induced vascular lesions exhibit subendothelial hyperplasia consisting of neointimal cells with a synthetic phenotype and abundant extracellular matrix, The role of the extracellular matrix in the formation of neointima is not known, In this study, we investigated whether osteopontin, an adhesive glycoprotein present in the extracellular matrix, is expressed in aortic smooth muscle tissue of the fowl abdominal aorta, in spontaneously developed neointimal plaques and in the aortic smooth muscle underlying neointimal plaques. Crude protein extracted from isolated aortic smooth muscle tissues and neointimal plaques was fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting with rabbit anti-fowl osteopontin (provided by Dr L. C. Gerstenfeld, Boston University) or anti-alpha smooth muscle actin antibodies. The anti-fowl osteopontin antibody predominantly recognized a 66-70kDa protein band in neointimal plaques that co-migrated with the osteopontin phosphoprotein from chick bone. In contrast, intact aortic smooth muscle and the smooth muscle underlying neointimal plaques equally expressed three proteins (66-70kDa, approximately 50kDa and approximately 43kDa) recognized by the anti-osteopontin antibody, Anti-alpha smooth muscle actin antibody recognized a 43kDa protein band, and the expression of alpha smooth muscle actin was higher in aortic smooth muscle than in neointimal plaques. Osteopontin mRNA expression was examined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of total RNA from vascular tissues with specific primers constructed on the basis of the reported fowl osteopontin nucleotide sequence. The PCR products from intact aortic smooth muscle and neointimal plaques correspond to the product from recombinant plasmid cDNA (a gift from Dr L, C, Gerstenfeld) transcribed in vitro. These results suggest that osteopontin is synthesized in intact aortic smooth muscle and neointimal plaques in fowl and that unmetabolized approximately 66kDa osteopontin protein is a predominant form in the neointima, indicating that osteopontin protein may be actively synthesized in the neointima.";"osteopontin; vascular smooth muscle; neointimal plaque; fowl; Gallus gallus; vascular lesion; alpha smooth muscle actin";2000;"JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY";"Biology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We developed a miniature video-camera system for use in grasslands and deployed it at 69 nests of 10 passerine species in North Dakota during 1996-97. Abandonment rates were higher at nests <1 day after camera deployment (23%) than <1 day after nests were found (2%, P = 0.001). most birds returned to nests less than or equal to 30 min after camera deployment, but clay-colored sparrows (Spizella pallida) took longer to return to nests than other species (P = 0.035). Cameras did not appear to increase nest predation rates. We videotaped predation by greater than or equal to 11 species at 29 nests: eggs or nestlings were destroyed by mice, ground squirrels, weasel, badgers, canids, deer, cowbirds, and hawks. All eggs or nestlings were removed in <15 min at 14 depredated nests. Contents were removed during >1 day or night (12-116 hr) at 6 nests, 5 of which were depredated by ground squirrels or mice. For nests without cameras, estimated predation rates were lower for ground nests than aboveground nests (P = 0.055), but did not differ between open and covered nests (P = 0.74). Open and covered nests differed, however, when predation risk (estimated by initial-predation rate) was examined separately for day and night using camera-monitored nests; the frequency of initial predations that occurred during the day was higher for open nests than covered nests (P = 0.015). Thus, vulnerability of some nest types may depend on the relative importance of nocturnal and diurnal predators. Predation risk increased with nestling age from 0 to 8 days (P = 0.07). Up to 15% of fates assigned to camera-monitored nests were wrong when based solely on evidence that would have been available from periodic nest visits. There was no evidence of disturbance at nearly half the depredated nests, including all 5 depredated by large mammals. Overlap in types of sign left by different predator species, and variability of sign within species, suggests that evidence at nests is unreliable for identifying predators of grassland passerines.";"camera; grassland passerines; nest fates; nest predators; nest success; North Dakota; northern Great Plains; video";2000;"JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Hatch date synchrony was substantial in all areas: on average, 67% of all clutches each year hatched within 6.5-8.8 days, within areas, similar to that among colonial avian species. The extent of synchrony was not correlated well with female density, in contrast to a general prediction from Darling's hypothesis for colonial species.

Adaptations must be explained either through natural selection for (individual) survival benefits or sexual selection for courtship and reproductive benefits Darwin argued that both birdsong and human music evolved as sexually selected courtship displays. Whereas his explanation of birdsong is widely accepted, his courtship hypothesis for human music has been neglected. Darwin's courtship hypothesis can be updated in the light of contemporary evolutionary psychology, biological signaling theory, and sexual selection theory. Some features of music seem to function as costly and reliable indicators of the producer's fitness, and others may have evolved through Fisher's runaway process as purely aesthetic signals. Although human music is usually made in groups, like many other courtship displays, no group selection account is necessary. To distinguish better between survival and courtship functions of music, we do, however, need much more cross-cultural, quantitative data on music production as a function of age, sex, mating status, and audience composition. Given that almost all complex acoustic signals produced by other species are courtship displays, this hypothesis for human music is not only better supported by music's design features, but should be considered the evolutionary null hypothesis.";NA;2000;"ORIGINS OF MUSIC";"Behavioral Sciences";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Improvement of freezing methods and AI equipment from 1970 onwards has rendered Al useful as a breeding technique for dogs. In parallel Al in foxes was developed in Scandinavia in the early 1980's; this resulted in the economically valuable crossbreeding of silver and blue foxes for the production of bluefrost pelts. Unfortunately, due to the particular physiology of the canine female, progress in other artificial breeding techniques has lagged behind. Only in the last few years have these techniques been successfully applied in basic research to study oocyte maturation, in vitro fertilization, embryo cryopreservation and embryo transfer in canids.

Domestication is attained by some combination of genetic changes occurring over generations and developmental mechanisms (e.g., physical maturation, learning) triggered by recurring environmental events or management practices in captivity that influence specific biological traits. The transition from free-living to captive status is often accompanied by changes in availability and/or accessibility of shelter, space, food and water, and by changes in predation and the social environment. These changes set the stage for the development of the domestic phenotype. Behavioral development in animals undergoing domestication is characterized by changes in the quantitative rather than qualitative nature of responses. The hypothesized loss of certain behavior patterns under domestication can usually be explained by the heightening of response thresholds. Increases in response frequency accompanying domestication can often be explained by atypical rates of exposure to certain forms of perceptual and locomotor stimulation. Genetic changes influencing the development of the domestic phenotype result from inbreeding, genetic drift, artificial selection, natural selection in captivity, and relaxed selection. Experiential contributions to the domestic phenotype include the presence or absence of key stimuli, changes in intraspecific aggressive interactions and interactions with humans. Man's role as a buffer between the animal and its environment is also believed to have an important effect on the development of the domestic phenotype. The domestication process has frequently reduced the sensitivity of animals to changes in their environment, perhaps the single-most important change accompanying domestication. It has also resulted in modified rates of behavioral and physical development. Interest in breeding animals in captivity for release in nature has flourished in recent decades. The capacity of domestic animals to survive and reproduce in nature may depend on the extent to which the gene pool of the population has been altered during the domestication process and flexibility in behavioral development. ""Natural"" gene pools should be protected when breeding wild animals in captivity for the purpose of reestablishing free-living natural populations. In some cases, captive-reared animals must be conditioned to Live in nature prior to their release. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

To determine how the intensity of paternal care affects reproductive success per brood sired or expressed as the total number of young raised in all nests controlled by the same male, it is necessary to manipulate paternal care. Testosterone (T) has been shown to depress the tendency for males to care for their young, and induces them to acquire more mates. The effects of paternal care on reproductive success were studied by treating certain male starlings with exogenous T and others with the antiandrogen cyproterone acetate (CA), and comparing the parental behavior of T- and CA-males throughout the breeding season with that of controls. CA-males fed their chicks more during the first week after hatching than T-males, with controls feeding at intermediate rates, both on a per nest basis and as total effort for all nests controlled by the same male. Paternal feeding rates during the first week of chick life had a significant positive effect on the number of fledged young. The hormone treatment significantly affected the number of chicks raised per nest, CA-males having a higher breeding success per nest than T-males, and controls showing intermediate levels of success; There was no significant effect of treatment on total reproductive success attained by males throughout the season.

Data on density and nesting success collected in 13 prairie fragments of various sizes revealed three levels of area sensitivity. The most area-sensitive species, Greater Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus cupido), was absent from small prairie fragments. An intermediate form of area sensitivity was apparent in only one species, Henslow's Sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii), which occurred in lower densities in small than in large prairie fragments. Based on census (i.e., distributional) data, only those tow species were area-sensitive (i.e., negatively affected by habitat fragmentation) in southwestern Missouri. A species can be sensitive not only on a distributional level, however, but also by having lower nesting success in small than in large prairie fragments. The Dickcissel (Spiza americana) was the only species that was area-sensitive on such a demographic level. These data indicate that we cannot rely solely on census data to describe the sensitivity of grassland-nesting species to habitat fragmentation, but that we also need to investigate demographic data (e.g., nesting success).

The ability of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) embryos to accelerate or retard hatching was tested by incubating separate clutches, of which three eggs had 2 d longer or shorter incubation time than the others, and observing their individual time of pipping (breaking of the shell). Mallard embryos were able to delay hatching by on average 0.6 d (43% of the eggs delayed at least 1 d), but were better at acceleration (on average 1.3 d; 91% of the eggs accelerated more than 1 d). Conversely, pheasant embryos were only able to accelerate by 0.4 d (50% accelerated more than 1 d), but were better at delaying the hatching (1.2 days; 77% delayed more than 1 d). This difference between the species may depend on different degrees of relatedness within clutches in pheasants and mallards.

We tested three predictions of this hypothesis for the evolutionary divergence of rock ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus) during the Wisconsin glaciation of the late Pleistocene, To do this, we examined subspecies distributions, population genetic structure, and phylogenetic relationships in 26 populations across North America and the Bering Sea region. First, we analyzed sequence variation in the mitochondrial control region, in a nuclear intron (Gapdh), and in an internal transcribed spacer (ITS1). Control region sequences of 154 rock ptarmigan revealed strong population and phylogeographic structure. Variation in intron sequences of 114 rock ptarmigan also revealed significant population structure compatible with results for the control region. Rock ptarmigan were invariant for ITS1. Second, we show that five known Nearctic refugia and an Icelandic refugium are concordant with the current distribution of morphologically distinct subspecies; five of these six refugia are geographically concordant with the distribution of closely related control region haplotypes. Third, our estimates of the time since phylogenetic lineages diverged predated the last glacial maximum for all but two lineages. In addition, all lines of evidence suggest that two unknown refugia in the Bering Sea region supported rock ptarmigan during the Wisconsin,glaciation. Overall, our results are most consistent with the hypothesis that isolated populations of rock ptarmigan diverged in multiple refugia during the Wisconsin and that geographic variation reflects patterns of recolonization of the Nearctic after the ice receded. The GRH may therefore offer the most plausible explanation for similar biogeographic patterns in a variety of Nearctic vertebrates.";"biogeography; control region; glacial refugium; intron; ITS1; phylogeography; Pleistocene; rock ptarmigan";1999;"EVOLUTION";"Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Corticosterone was detectable (>2.6 ng/ml) in 30% of 5-day-old, 67% of 10-day-old, 72% of 15-day-old, and 88% of 23-day-old birds. When detectable, the corticosterone levels of 5-day-old nestlings were comparable to the baseline levels of adult birds. Levels were higher in 10- and 15- than in 5-day-old nestlings. The levels of 23-day-old fledglings (about 6 to 7 days after fledging) were significantly higher than those of 15-day-old nestlings. They were intermediate between adult baseline and stress-induced levels. Sex did not influence this general profile, but levels varied with the order of hatching within broods. At the age of 15 and 23 days first hatched chicks had higher corticosterone levels than last hatched chicks, while second hatched chicks had intermediate levels. These differences were not correlated with body mass. The results suggest that (1) the brain-pituitary-adrenal axis of this altricial bird becomes fully functional after hatching and (2) birth order within broods influences corticosterone secretion during subsequent stages of development. It is unlikely that the brain-pituitary-adrenal axis matures at different rates in first and later hatched chicks or that the different levels of first and later hatched chicks were caused by capture and handling stress. Rather, they may result from such maternal effects as hatching asynchrony or differential concentrations of yolk steroids among the eggs in a clutch. Further studies will have to show whether this systematic variation of corticosterone levels among siblings during early life persists into adulthood and how it is related to behavior and fitness.

Their territoriality was also estimated from their singing response to song playbacks. The pattern of change detected in the levels of plasma testosterone was different from that of ""typical"" monogamous species but similar to that of polygynous species. In ""typical"" monogamous species, plasma testosterone levels elevated during territory settlement and courtship behavior and then declined to low stable levels during incubation. In bush warblers, plasma levels of testosterone were already high (1-2 ng/ml) upon arrival in late March and peaked (2.5-4 ng/ml) in early June. They then decreased but relatively high levels were maintained until early August. In late August the testosterone concentration was 0.03 ng/ml or less. Plasma levels of corticosterone also showed a seasonal change, being highest in May to July and declining in late August. Territoriality showed clear seasonality, reflecting the levels of circulating testosterone. Upon arrival, latency periods for responses to song playback were long and singing activity was rather low but this behavior was soon stabilized and a high degree of territoriality was maintained to late August. These results suggest that high levels of circulating testosterone and corticosterone allow males to pursue a polygynous breeding strategy, to hold a territory and to maintain breeding activity for a prolonged period, characteristics which are likely to be adaptations to dense bushes with high rates of predation and brood parasitism of this species.

By contrast, few studies have investigated how behaviours prior to the breeding season influence mate choice during the mating period. Males in many species of birds exhibit behaviours that resemble mating behaviours typically performed during the breeding season, even though environmental conditions are then not suitable for breeding. In one such species, the lekking Black Grouse Tetrao tetrix, both males and females visit leks regularly in autumn. Between 1988 and 1994 we studied autumn lekking and its relation to the performance of males and females in spring in a Black Grouse population in central Finland. We found that virtually all males. regardless of their previous copulation success, joined the lek in autumn, and that territory defence, in terms of fighting behaviour, was as intense in autumn as in spring. Furthermore; males that did not establish their territories until spring were less successful in obtaining copulations than males that established their territories in the previous autumn or earlier. In addition, males possessing central territories in autumn had higher copulation success in the following spring, probably because Females visited the same male territories in autumn and in the following spring. Our results suggest that males lek in autumn to increase. their copulation success in the following spring.

In this study adrenal and thyroidal feedback mechanisms were studied. Administration of corticosterone 30 min prior to an ovine CRH (oCRH) challenge diminished the in vivo sensitivity of thyrotrophs to oCRH in 19-day-old chicken embryos (E19) (20 mu g corticosterone; 2 mu g oCRH) but not in 8-day-old chickens (C8) (40 mu g corticosterone; 4 mu g oCRH). At both ages studied, corticosterone (0.01 and 1 mu M) did not alter the in vitro TSH response to oCRH (100 nM) indicating that an indirect mechanism is involved at the embryonic stage which is no longer present in posthatch chickens. In vitro, 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T-3) pretreatment (0.01 and 1 mu M) resulted at both ages studied in a dose-dependent drop in the in vitro oCRH-induced TSH release,As recorded previously, corticosterone treatment provoked a rise in plasma T-3 in embryonic but not in posthatch chickens. The presence of an indirect adrenal feedback mechanism in chicken embryos may therefore be linked to the increase in plasma T-a which will alter the sensitivity of thyrotrophs to hypothalamic releasing factors. In conclusion, corticosterone does not directly modulate the responsiveness of thyrotrophs to CRH, but its feedback mechanism may be dependent on the evoked increase in plasma T-3 which is only present in embryonic chickens. Corticosterone may in this regard play an essential role during embryonic development by coordinating thyroidal feedback mechanisms at the level of the chicken pituitary.

However, the technique is biased against small predators that are unable to destroy large, thick-shelled quail eggs but that are capable of breaking small passerine eggs. To avoid this bias, many researchers use eggs made of modeling clay that can be readily marked by small predators. Unfortunately, modeling clay has an odor that may influence predator behavior. To determine if clay eggs suffered higher rates of predation than quail eggs and whether clay had an odor that influenced predators, we placed 135 artificial ground nests containing either clay, quail, or quail eggs scented dth a clay odor. Nests filled with quail eggs had higher cumulative survival (63%: n = 45) than those with clay eggs (27%: n = 45). However, clay odor did not attract predators, as nests with quail eggs suffered similar frequency of predation (63%: n = 45) to those containing ""clay-scented"" quail eggs (63%: n = 45).

However, edges may be of various types (e.g., interior or exterior, abrupt or gradual), which may not always result in elevated predation. We compared predation rates on artificial arboreal nests along three types of edges in a bottomland forest in North Carolina during the 1996 breeding season. Edge types were forest-farm, forest-river, and the transition zone between the two dominant forest types in the floodplain (cypress-gum swamps-natural levees). We tested for differences in predation rates using two egg types: Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and clay eggs. Predation rates were higher (P < 0.05) along forest-farm edges than along the other two edges. Predation rates did not differ between forest-river and transition zone edges. Patterns of predation on the two egg types and higher avian predator abundance on forest-farm edges suggested that avian predators may have exerted more predation pressure along these edges. These results are consistent with other studies, which suggest that encroachment by agriculture into forested landscapes may negatively affect breeding birds. Our findings also suggest that not all edge types are equivalent in terms of predation rates. This is important in assessing the conservation value of bottomland forests, which may contain various edge types resulting from natural processes (e.g., hydrodynamics).";NA;1999;"WILSON BULLETIN";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We investigated the location(s), the timing, and the extent to which these GDNF receptors appear in the population of crest-derived precursors that form the avian ENS using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Sections and whole mounts of embryonic chick. gastrointestinal tract were costained with antibodies to the receptors and to HNK-1, a marker for crest-derived cells. Neural crest-derived precursors migrate through the primitive esophagus to colonize the gizzard where an extensive cellular network forms. Ret-immunoreactivity (ir) was found in a network of cells in the gizzard at embryonic day (E)3.5. As development proceeded, Ret-immunoreactive cells appeared at progressively more caudal positions and were present in the colon at E7.5. Costaining with Ret and HNK-1 was performed to determine the number of Ret-immunoreactive cells in the crest-derived population. Ret appeared in some HNK-1 cells in the esophagus and gizzard at embryonic day (E)3.5. During development, the number of crest cells with Ret increased in the ganglia of the gizzard and small intestine. GFR alpha 1-ir was also found in HNK-1 cells in the esophagus at E3.5 but did not appear in the gizzard until E4.5. Surprisingly, the colonizing vanguard of crest-derived cells lacked both Ret- and GFR alpha-ir. Between E4.5 and E6.5, the fraction of HNK-1-positive cells expressing GFR alpha 1 increased considerably in the foregut. Ret and GFR alpha 1 were coexpressed in many cells at E6.5, and the number of such cells increased as development progressed. In the adult, GFR alpha 1 and Ret were found in the neuropil of enteric ganglia. We conclude that the population of cells expressing the receptors increases during development and persists in the adult, findings that support a neurotrophic role for GDNF in the formation and maintenance of the avian ENS.

However, a convincing example of Lorenzian regulation has been lacking. We studied dustbathing in featherless and feathered chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, the latter trained to dustbathe on glass with sand underneath. In both cases the function, that is, plumage cleaning, was eliminated. In both featherless and feathered chicks dustbathing increased with time since the last performance as found in normal dustbathing, and there was a compensatory adjustment when the amount of previous dustbathing was artificially reduced. We suggest that the amount of dustbathing performed at any one time may be controlled by the cooperative action of a deprivation or timer mechanism and a counter mechanism. The timer mechanism responds to the time since the last performance, whereas the counter mechanism records the number of elements during that last dustbathing. Alternatively, there may be a single mechanism that continually records the deficit in the amount of dustbathing performed. Lorenz's model may be valid not only for dustbathing in fowl but also for other comfort behaviours. Our results suggest the existence of behavioural needs that can be satisfied only by performance.

However, using experience may cause behavior to lag behind the current state of the environment, and estimates may suffer from sampling errors. We used stochastic dynamic models to examine the environmental conditions that favor flexible rather than fixed estimates and behaviors. The examination was conducted in the context of reproductive decisions made by the female peacock wrasse (Symphodus tinca), a nearshore Mediterranean fish. Female peacock wrasses can choose to spawn in a nest, with males that defend these nests within territories, or our of a nest, with males that defend neither territories nor nests. A female must expend effort and time to find nesting males, and the profitability of this search, relative to spawning with nonnesting males, changes with the density of nests and relative hatching success of eggs in and out of nests. A female can increase her fitness by estimating the environment's state and matching her reproductive decisions to the current environment. These estimates can be flexible and formed by experience, or fixed and formed by selection. We found that flexible estimates based on experience do better when there is variance within and between seasons and when there is greater uncertainty. The optimal rate for forgetting experiences is set by the rate of environmental change. Comparisons of predicted female behavior using flexible and fixed estimates with observed behavior suggest that females use estimates that are updated by experience.";"Bayesian; learning; optimal forgetting; peacock wrasse; plasticity; Symphodus tinca; variable environments";1999;"BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY";"Behavioral Sciences; Biology; Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

In the mid 1990s numbers of sheep generally remained far higher than in the mid 1970s. Wales stands out as showing an increase throughout the period since 1950 and as a region of exceptionally high sheep density. These broad trends conceal much local variation. There is concern about the implications for bird populations, especially in the Welsh uplands, and the mechanisms are reviewed by which the increase in sheep may have affected birds, especially in semi-natural upland habitats. Grazing can potentially affect bird populations through a large number of mechanisms but principal ones are likely to be: (1) loss of preferred vegetation types, (2) alteration of food supplies and (3) alteration of predation pressure. The recent increases in sheep have almost certainly caused reduction in habitat quality for ground-nesting birds such as grouse and waders in some regions. However, firm evidence linking declines in upland birds to increases in sheep is largely unavailable because (a) there is inadequate monitoring of upland birds, (b) habitat-specific information on changes in grazing pressure is generally lacking, (c) there has been little relevant research on mechanisms, (d) effects of severe grazing cannot be readily isolated from other factors such as acidification and changes in predation pressure. It is suggested that the apparent collapse in Welsh upland bird populations may be a response to this recent increase in grazing pressure superimposed on a long-term reduction in carrying capacity.

We were unable to detect an effect of predator removal on survival of natural (n = 153 nests) or simulated (n = 2264 nests) nests of grassland songbirds in either year. However, the assemblage of predators destroying simulated nests differed between removal and non-removal sites in 1995, when medium-sized carnivores and small mammals were the most important predators on non-removal sites, whereas ground squirrels were most important on removal sites. Our study indicates that grassland songbirds were not negatively affected, at least in the short term, by removal of duck nest predators. However, changes in the relative importance of predators on removal sites in 1995 suggest that smaller predators that were not targeted by removal efforts (i.e., ground squirrels) may have caused compensatory predation.

In an early-June sampling of predation on artificial nests containing quail eggs, egg losses and jay activity levels were significantly higher in forest adjacent to human-created edge than in undisturbed interior forest. In a late-June sampling, however, nest predation near edges was significantly reduced, and this was correlated with a drop in jay activity (detected via predator censuses and remote-controlled camera stations baited with artificial nests). Steller's jays in natural nests monitored during the study fledged their chicks between the two samplings, which suggests that quail eggs were an important food for jays during their nestling period (early June) but not after (late June). Nests in the two plots in interior forest, where jays were rarely detected, had consistently low nest predation rates in both samplings. These data support the hypothesis that during their nestling period, adult Steller's jays in southeast Alaska may prey intensively on the contents of other birds' nests in the vicinity of their own nests, but that fledging of jay chicks abruptly changes foraging patterns, including possibly reducing nest-predation behavior. Given the short breeding season in southeast Alaska, it is likely that during the postfledging period, jay families concentrate on obtaining foods (e.g., conifer seeds) that are more important for over-winter survival of the juveniles than nest contents, which decrease rapidly in abundance during July.";NA;1999;"CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE";"Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Accordingly, we measured oxygen consumption and cytochrome oxidase activity, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activity and overall antioxidant capacity, and lipid peroxidation and response to oxidative stress in vitro in liver. The order of liver oxygen consumption and cytochrome oxidase activity among the different species mras rat > chick > Lizard > frog. The antioxidant defenses supplied by the combined action of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase were not adapted to the respiratory capacities. In particular, there was no correlation either between the activities of two enzymes or between their activities and oxygen consumption. In contrast, the overall antioxidant capacity of the liver appeared to be related to its oxidative capacity, and the malondialdehyde formation, an indirect measure of lipid peroxidation, was inversely related to antioxidant capacity. The response to oxidative stress in vitro indicated that the liver susceptibility to oxidative challenge is higher in ecto thermic than in endothermic species. Such higher susceptibility appeared to depend on both lower antioxidant capacity and higher levels of free radical producing species. This finding is apparently in contrast with a higher content of cytochromes in endotherms, which are able to determine both respiratory characteristics and sensitivity to pro-oxidants. However, it could indicate the existence of species-related differences in the tissue content of either preventive antioxidants or hemoproteins able to trap the radicals produced at their active center.

We predicted a decrease in the size of male goshawks from the 1960s because availability of their main prey, grouse, has decreased since then and grouse have been replaced in the diet by smaller prey during the breeding season. Based on the assumption that winter is the most critical period for females, we predicted that female size should have increased because their winter diet consisted of more and more mountain hare, which is a prey generally larger than grouse. Analyses revealed that male size has indeed decreased since the 1960s, while adult females have increased in size. Our data suggest that these morphological shifts were the result of selective pressures due to changes in diet. We also found changes in the (size-independent) shape of the hawks. Relative wing and tail lengths of adult hawks became longer between 1980 and 1990 compared with the 1960-1970 period, while relative juvenile wing and tail lengths tended to decrease.

I studied spatial attributes of 113 Wild Turkey nests to determine landscape-scale habitat characteristics that were important for nest placement and survival. Hens generally nested close to roads in large pine patches that occurred on southeast-facing slopes. Hens selected shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata; 68.1%) over mixed hardwood (23.9%), hardwood (0.9%), and open areas (7.1%). Most of the hens (57.5%) placed their nests in edge habitat, but placement in these areas did not influence nesting success. Rather, female turkeys appeared to respond to a high risk of predation by placing nests in large patches, away from areas of high edge density favored by nest predators. Mean patch size chosen by nesting females (6,912.6 +/- SE of 634.5 ha) was considerably larger than the mean patch size for the study area (31.4 +/- 7.8 ha). Although most hens nested close to roads, this association appeared to be detrimental to nesting success because all nests close to roads were unsuccessful. In general, habitat characteristics examined at the level of patch and stand were good predictors of nest location but poor predictors of nesting success, possibly due to a high abundance of edge habitat in the landscape. This large amount of edge apparently sustained predator populations that made even the largest patches hazardous for nesting by Wild Turkeys. Therefore, the lack of suitable nest sites may limit population size of Wild Turkeys in the Ouachita Mountains.";NA;1999;"AUK";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The authors undertook studies of the circadian and photoperiodic system of Japanese quail to try to identify a role for the circadian system in photoperiodic time measurement. The circadian studies showed that the circadian system acts like a low-amplitude oscillator: It is readily reset by Light without significant transients, has a Type 0 phase response curve (PRC), and has a large range of entrainment. In fact, a cycle length that is often used in resonance protocols (LD 6:30) is within the range of entrainment. The authors employed T-cycle experiments; that is, LD cycles with 6- and 14-h photoperiods and period lengths ranging from 18 to 36 h to test for circadian involvement in photoperiodic time measurement. The results did not give evidence for circadian involvement in photoperiodic time measurement: T-cycles utilizing 6-h photoperiods were uniformly noninductive (that is, did not stimulate the reproductive system), whereas T-cycles utilizing 14-h photoperiods were inductive (stimulatory).

Hypoxia, which is a normal developmental condition for late chick embryos, causes a decrease of the red cell ATP concentration (and increase of red cell oxygen affinity) as well as activation of 2,3BPG synthesis via cyclic AMP-dependent signaling. Adenosine and catecholamines have been implicated as signaling substances in these red cell responses, To assess the extent to which adenosine and catecholamines are involved in vivo in the control of red cell ATP/2,3BPG concentrations, day 13 chick embryos were treated for 24 h with adenosine A(2) and/or beta-adrenergic receptor blockers and red cell ATP and 2,3BPG levels were determined.

It is generally acknowledged that the peacock is polygamous; whichever male has the most attractive plumage wins the most females and therefore achieves the greatest reproductive success. It is due to selective breeding by the females, i.e. ""female choice"" that the males have become what they are today. In monogamous mating systems, however, the source of striking colouring in males could not be explained the same way until evidence for the common occurrence of ""extra-pair copulation"" became more accepted. This mating behaviour offers an explanation of how certain males, even in monogamous species, can produce more offspring than others. Only in recent years was it recognised that it is often the females which play the active role in the initiation of extra-pair copulation. What fitness gains can the females expect to achieve through this behaviour? This review commences with an introduction to fundamental theories of sexual selection. Progressing from this, the current discussion of extra-pair copulation (EPC) is reviewed. Conceivable fitness gains for the females, which may have resulted in the evolution of EPC, are summarised. A connection is noted between the various possible fitness gains in their effect on the ""total reproductive value"" of the females. The necessity of considering all of these theories from a more general perspective, without having to dismiss any explanations from the outset, is made clear Gowaty's ""constrained female hypothesis"" (1996) is one example in which this has been achieved. This hypothesis proposes that females can be obliged to engage in EPC in order to obtain any kind of extra fitness gain, since they are often constrained in their choice of a partner (e.g. by the males themselves). In conclusion, possible directions are suggested for the testing of these hypotheses in field studies; in future more emphasis should be put on intrinsic quality differences between the females while investigating their mating behaviour.";"sexual selection; extra-pair copulation; female choice; reproductive value; constrained female hypothesis";1999;"JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Change in land management is thought to be a primary cause of this decline, but the invasion of northern bobwhite habitats by the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) also may be involved. We compared hatching success and subsequent survival of wild northern bobwhite chicks on the Coastal Prairie of Texas in 1997 and 1998 between broods that hatched under natural conditions or following fire ant suppression treatments. In 1997, the fire ant suppression treatment resulted in a 70% reduction in the number of red imported fire ants on baits placed in treated nests on the day after hatch. Using 2 fire ant suppression treatments in 1998 reduced the number of red imported fire ants on baits by >99%. No year or treatment x year interaction effects were detected for hatching success or survival, and no treatment effect was detected for hatching success (P > 0.10). However, the proportion of chicks surviving to 21 days was higher (P = 0.010) for treated nests (n = 18) than control nests (n = 25; proportions of broods surviving: 53.5 +/- 8.6% [(x) over bar +/- SE] vs. 24.7 +/- 6.6%; chick survival: 60.1 +/- 7.6% vs. 22.0 +/- 6.2%). The probability of chick survival decreased (P < 0.001) as our index of red imported fire ant activity in the nest increased. These results indicate northern bobwhite chicks can suffer high levels of mortality due to red imported fire ants, which could explain declines in some northern bobwhite populations following infestations by red imported fire ants. Current methods for controlling red imported fire ants are expensive and may last <3 months. Thus, strategies for mitigating the effect of red imported fire ants to northern bobwhite populations in this area should probably focus on reducing other mortality factors or increasing productivity.";"Colinus virginianus; envenomation; exotic insect; exotic species; fire ant; northern bobwhite; reproduction; Solenopsis invicta; survival; Texas";1999;"JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Tests were carried out when the chicks were 1-, 3- and 6-weeks of age. IIDs were established within 1 min and remained stable thereafter. In HSR and mixed line pairs, but not LSR line pairs, IIDs increased with age. IIDs were shorter in HSR line pairs than in LSR or mixed line pairs at 1- and 3-weeks of age but not at 6-weeks of age when IIDs were similar in all pair-types. At 1- and 3-weeks of age, IIDs in mixed line pairs were intermediate to those in HSR and LSR line pairs. The sex of the pair-members did not influence IIDs. Previous studies have shown that selection for SR behaviour, in quail chicks, has effects that persist into later life and influence characters not present in the birds' behavioural repertoire at the time of testing for the purposes of selection. Such behaviour patterns include aggression, sexual behaviour and socio-sexual proximity behaviour. All of these behaviour patterns are expressed at higher levels in HSR line birds than LSR line birds. Differences in IIDs between HSR and LSR line birds may, therefore, be due to an interaction between environmental and genetic effects. In young HSR chicks, social reinstatement is the primary motivation and IIDs are short. However, as the HSR line chicks' age, IIDs reflect an interaction between social attraction and aggression related avoidance behaviour that tends to increase IIDs. In LSR line chicks aggression and social motivation are low at all ages and IIDs tend to remain stable. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Apoptotic cells were identified by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling technique, and microglial precursors were identified by immunocytochemistry with an antibody recognizing quail microglial cells (QH1 antibody). Apoptotic cells were first detectable in the GCL at the seventh day of incubation (E7), were most abundant at E10, and were absent after E13. In the INL, apoptotic cells first appeared at E7, were most abundant at E12, and disappeared entirely after the third posthatching day (P3). In both retinal layers, cell death first appeared in a small central area of the retina and subsequently spread along three gradients: central-to-peripheral, temporal-to-nasal, and dorsal-to-ventral, The chronology of tangential (between E7 and E16) and radial migration (between E8 and P3) of microglial precursors was highly coincident with that of cell death in the GCL and INL. Comparison of the chronotopographical pattern of distribution of apoptotic nuclei in the GCL with the patterns of tangential and radial migration of microglial precursors neither supported nor refuted the hypothesis that ganglion cell death is the stimulus that triggers the entry and migration of microglial precursors in the developing retina. However, microglial cells in most of the retina traversed the INL only after cell death had ceased in this layer, suggesting that cell death in the INL does not attract microglial precursors migrating radially.

In this paper we consider the impact of a population which is a tick host but non-viraemic on one which is both a tick host and viraemic. We present two simple deterministic models and use joint threshold density curves to illustrate the basic reproductive ratios of both the ticks and the virus. We find that the non-viraemic hosts can have considerable impact on the viraemic host. Either they amplify the tick population and cause the virus to persist, or they dilute the infection and cause it to die out.

However, mounting an immune response against a foreign antigen may in itself constitute a cost for developing organisms. This cost has potentially long-term consequences for adult function and fitness. This study examines the growth and developmental stability of Japanese quail chicks challenged by three non-pathogenic antigens: sheep red blood cells, which assess T-cell-dependent immune responses, and Mycoplasma synoviae and Newcastle disease virus, which assess T-cell-independent responses. Increases in both body mass and wing length were significantly reduced in antigen-challenged birds compared to control birds. Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in the masses of primary feathers increased from the innermost (1) to the outermost (10) position on the wing. In addition, antigen challenge by M. synoviae and sheep red blood cells was associated with an increase in FA. The cell-mediated response measured by reaction to phytohaemagglutinin was significantly depressed in hi. synoviae-challenged birds. White blood cell counts, except for monocytes, were elevated in response to all three antigen treatments. Total plasma protein and haematocrit also differed between treatments but exhibited no clear relationship to antigen challenge. Immune responses clearly impose a stress on developing chicks.

There is, however, no unique way to measure inequality. We review 21 measures used to quantify it and clarify the conceptual difference between inequality and skewness. In two very different families of distributions, all indices except three give higher values for more unequal distributions of resources, although some of them are poor at distinguishing between similar inequality values. When applied correctly by testing against a null hypothesis of no inequality among individuals, most indices can therefore be used to detect deviations from randomness, but with varying ease as most lack statistical tables and rely on resampling techniques instead. As an example to test the performance of the 21 indices, we used each index to analyze 71 data sets of unequal mating success in leks. In pairwise comparisons, 24% of the indices fail to show a positive intercorrelation. This reflects differences in how indices incorporate variation in the number of competitors and mean acquisition of the resource. All indices are sensitive to these aspects if inequality is measured in data arising from different distributions. These results illustrate the general conclusion that a unique ""best"" solution is not available; each measure presents its own definition of inequality. The choice of an inequality index requires specifying the null expectations and interpreting deviating values in relation to the biological question being addressed. This means, for example, considering individual male mating success in the context of lekking or relating the mass distribution of individual plants to alternative hypotheses about competition in plant population ecology.

The chicks were 4 or 12 days of age and had been reared in enriched pens that allowed them to move out of sight of the imprinting object, or control pens that did not. In experiment 1, 44 chicks viewed a positional cue, which was a stationary imprinting object placed for 1 min in front of one of two possible hiding locations (each concealing an identical imprinting object) either to the left or right of the chick. When released, chicks moved towards, and spent more time in, the side in which the positional cue had been presented. We presented a further 44 chicks with a directional cue, which involved an imprinting object moving from near one possible hiding location towards the other and its occlusion midway between the two possible hiding locations. When released, chicks moved towards, and spent more time in, the opposite side to that indicated by the visible direction of movement of the imprinting object. Additionally, chicks reared in enriched pens spent more time in the side in which the imprinting object was seen than chicks reared in control pens. We examined the relative influence of positional and directional cues in experiment 2, by providing both cues sequentially to 88 chicks. Chicks spent more time in the positional cue side, when the directional cue offered complementary information, but no side preference was found when cues provided contradictory information. We conclude that in this study, orientation towards a concealed object was based on previous spatial location alone, with little influence from the temporal aspects of the presentation such as movement before occlusion or last-seen location. We discuss the possibility that chicks imprinting on a stationary object develop a strategy for locating a concealed social stimulus that is unrepresentative of chicks reared by a hen.

Male red grouse display a high degree of natal philopatry, are territorial, and show less aggression to kin than to non-kin. Such Factors acting in combination predict limited male-mediated gene flow, which will promote social structure within a population by the formation of stable kin clusters, and facilitate a rapid rise in allelic coancestry and/or inbreeding. In this study we utilize hypervariable microsatellite polymorphisms to examine the extent of social affiliation between relatives in a moorland population of grouse from NE Scotland. Levels of genetic relatedness between individual male red grouse occupying territories at Glas Choille in the spring and autumn of 1995 were examined, and kin clusters delimited, Nine kin groups (mean size = 2.1 individuals) were identified prior to breeding in the spring, which increased to 11 kin groups (mean size =4.0 individuals) when territories were reformed in the autumn. The majority of those individuals that were recruited into the adult population during the autumn already had a first-order male relative established, supporting the hypothesis that recruitment is facilitated by behavioural interactions among relatives. The demographic and population genetic consequences of philopatric recruitment and kin clustering are examined and discussed.

The most striking difference was that the proportion of a-linolenic acid (18:3n-3) was far greater in all yolk lipid classes [triacylglycerol (TAG), phospholipid (PL), cholesteryl ester (CE)] of the wild birds than in the captive birds of both species. For example, in yolk TAG, the level (wt.% of total fatty acids) of 18:3n-3 was only 1.6% in eggs of captive pheasants compared with 27.9% in eggs of the wild birds. The proportions of 18:3n-3 in yolk TAG of housed, free-range and feral geese were 0.6, 6.6 and 19.3% respectively. It is suggested that these differences arise from the predominance of linoleic acid (18:2n-6) as the major polyunsaturate in the commercial grain-based feeds whereas geese and pheasants in the wild consume grasses and green shoots in which 18:3n-3 is the main fatty acid. The concentrations of vitamin E and carotenoids in the yolks of the free-range and feral geese were much greater than in those of the housed geese. Thus the developing embryos of pheasants and geese in the wild will have access to far higher levels of n-3 polyunsaturates and lipid-soluble antioxidants compared with embryos of the housed birds.

A synthesis of statistical and mechanistic modeling approaches";"Population cycles have long fascinated ecologists. Even in the most-studied populations, however, scientists continue to dispute the relative importance of various potential causes of the cycles, Over the past three decades, theoretical ecologists have cataloged a large number of mechanisms that are capable of generating cycles in population models. At the same time, statisticians have developed new techniques both for characterizing time series and for fitting population models to time-series data. Both disciplines are now sufficiently advanced that great gains in understanding can be made by synthesizing these complementary, and heretofore mostly independent, quantitative approaches. In this paper we demonstrate how to apply this synthesis to the problem of population cycles, using both long-term population time series and the often-rich observational and experimental data on the ecology of the species in question. We quantify hypotheses by writing mathematical models that embody the interactions and forces that might cause cycles. Some hypotheses can be rejected out of hand, as being unable to generate even qualitatively appropriate dynamics, We finish quantifying the remaining hypotheses by estimating parameters, both from independent experiments and from fitting the models to the time-series data using modern statistical techniques, Finally, we compare simulated time series generated by the models to the observed time series, using a variety of statistical descriptors, which we refer to collectively as ""probes."" The model most similar to the data, as measured by these probes, is considered to be the most likely candidate to represent the mechanism underlying the population cycles. We illustrate this approach by analyzing one of Nicholson's blowfly populations, in which we know the ""true"" governing mechanism. Our analysis, which uses only a subset of the information available about the population, uncovers the correct answer, suggesting that this synthetic approach might be successfully applied to field populations as well.";"blowflies; density dependence; fitting mechanistic models to time-series data; inverse problem; Lucilia cuprina; mechanistic population models; modeling population cycles; population cycles, determining the causes of; statistical time-series analysis; structured population models; time-series models";1999;"ECOLOGY";"Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The functional and numerical responses of two generalist raptors (hen harrier and peregrine) were studied on one moor for 6 years and on five other moors for 5 years. 2. Neither species showed numerical responses to grouse abundance. Harrier densities were highest in areas and years where their small prey (meadow pipits and small mammals) were most abundant. Peregrine densities were highest on southern study moors, probably in association with high abundance of racing pigeons. 3. For harriers preying on grouse chicks, the available data fitted a sigmoidal or type III functional response. Peregrines showed a type II response to adult grouse densities around eyries. 4. The proportion of grouse chicks taken by harriers was estimated to have been highest at densities of 67 chicks km(-2) (equivalent to a mean of about 12 broods km(-2)). The proportion of adult grouse taken by peregrines appeared to be inversely density dependent, such that an increasing proportion of grouse was taken at grouse densities below 20 km(-2) 5. In the absence of persecution, the impact of harriers on grouse populations is most likely to be greatest on moors where alternative prey and thus harriers are abundant.

In many species of birds, the proportion of females that relays after losing their first clutch varies. Replacement clutches can make important contributions to an individual's lifetime reproductive success, so the decision on whether or not to relay may have significant consequences for fitness. 2. Many studies report that female birds of 'high quality' (e.g. older and more experienced) were more likely to relay following clutch loss, and that the proportion of females that relaid declined as the breeding season progressed. High quality females tend to nest early, and may be less likely to lose their clutches. As a result, it is unclear whether few females relay late in the season because there are prohibitive costs associated with late breeding, or because those females that lay and lose their eggs late are of low quality, and therefore incapable of relaying, 3. We examined the roles of dare and quality in causing seasonal declines in replacement layings in Brunnich's guillemot [Uria lomvia (Linnaeus)], a long-lived, Arctic marine bird that lays a one-egg clutch. At two low-arctic colonies in eastern Canada in 1996 and 1997, the single egg was experimentally removed from samples of early-laying pairs (presumably those of high quality) at 3-day intervals beginning on the median laying date and ending 12 days later. 4. In the general population, the proportion of pairs that relaid following natural egg loss declined with the date of loss. In contrast, the proportion of experimental pairs that relaid remained high irrespective of the date their egg was removed. These results support the quality hypothesis, but not the date hypothesis. We conclude that seasonal declines in replacement layings occurred primarily because increasing proportions of low quality females lost eggs as the season advanced. 5. The experimental pairs also suffered no overt reduction in reproductive success as a result of the delay, at least up to the time that their chicks departed to sea. This suggests that timing of breeding had little effect on the immediate success of more capable pairs. 6. Our results may have important implications about the seasonality of low-Arctic marine environments, and the life histories of birds that inhabit them.";"breeding success; egg loss; female quality; renesting; timing of breeding";1999;"JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Comparisons with recaptures and recoveries of 238 ringed juveniles without radio-tags detected no marking bias among hawks radio-tagged at nests, nor survival bias from tag impacts or signal-loss effects, but disproportionate adult deaths within a month of trapping. 3. Among 63 dead hawks found by radio-tagging, 35% were killed by humans and 65% died from natural causes, mainly starvation. Ring recoveries over-represented killing by humans. 4. Radio-tagging estimated first-year male survival rates of 0.49-0.54 to the next spring, lower than estimates of 0.69-0.71 for females; combined survival was higher than in contemporary ringing records. Excluding first-month data from trapped adults, second-year survival was 0.59 for males, 0.71 for females, and 0.79-0.83 for both sexes thereafter. 5. No hawks were observed to build nests or lay eggs in their first year. Only 8% of radio-tagged females laid eggs in their second year, but 47% of older females. Second-year males were as often as older males in egg-laying pairs (70%), bur were less likely to rear young. 6.

Gyrfalcon predation on ptarmigan during the breeding season was studied in north-east Iceland 1981-97, The ptarmigan population went through a complete 10-year cycle of numbers with a 4.3-fold difference in density between high and low years. The yearly number of occupied gyrfalcon territories was correlated with ptarmigan density with a 3-year time-lag. Total falcon numbers in late summer (territorial adults + fledglings) showed a 2-year lag with ptarmigan numbers. Variability in falcon density was significantly less than that of ptarmigan. It is suggested that the factors contributing to the time-lag between the two populations are the year-round residency of falcons on nesting territories, and late maturity (2- to 4-year-old), Mean brood size and the proportion of the territorial falcon population breeding successfully showed no relation to ptarmigan numbers. 2. Ptarmigan density in spring was an important, factor determining composition and variability in the diet of gyrfalcons during the breeding season. Alternative prey for falcons included waterfowl, alcids and waders. Adult ptarmigan featured highly in gyrfalcon diet in all years. The functional response curve to changes in ptarmigan density was slightly convex or close to linear and showed relatively little change in the average number of ptarmigan killed per individual predator over the range of ptarmigan densities observed. 3. The impact of gyrfalcon predation on the ptarmigan population and ptarmigan density was in opposite phases, and the predation rate peaked during the decline and the low phase of the ptarmigan cycle. This suggests that gyrfalcons accelerate decline, accentuate the amplitude and affect the length of the low phase of the ptarmigan cycle, The following factors seem to promote the destabilizing effects of predation by gyrfalcons: they are resident specialist predators, they show a delayed numerical response to changes in ptarmigan density and a high utilization of this prey at all phases of the ptarmigan cycle.";"Falco rusticolus; Lagopus mutus; predator-prey relationships; resident specialist predator; time-lags; 10-year cycles";1999;"JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We examined the effects of IMHV lesions in a one-trial, nongustatory, sickness-conditioned learning task. This task is similar to passive avoidance and imprinting because all three tasks require the chick to remember visual cues in order to respond correctly. However, sickness-conditioned learning differs from imprinting and passive avoidance because it uses sickness as the aversive stimulus and there is a longer conditioned stimulus-unconditioned stimulus interval (30-min delay compared to seconds). Bilateral IMHV lesions given 24 h before training impaired the ability of the chicks to avoid a bead associated with sickness produced by Lithium chloride injection, as did pretraining unilateral left or right IMKV lesions. Post-training IMHV lesions given 1 h after training did not impair avoidance of the test bead in the sickness-conditioned learning task. However, lesioned chicks showed generalized avoidance of all test beads. The pretraining lesion results are similar to those found in imprinting and passive avoidance learning; however, the effects of unilateral IMKV lesions differed. Post-training lesion effects are similar to those found in passive avoidance learning.

The efficacious dose range for ritanserin in these studies had very little or no effect on the above measures of toxicity when administered alone. In the present study, we extend our characterization of ritanserin's potential toxicity, or lack thereof, to include the normal behavioral and endocrine responses to immune system stimulation by the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS administration induces a syndrome collectively known as sickness behavior, manifest as altered thermoregulatory processes leading to fever, and increased serum concentrations of neuroendocrine hormones, including corticosterone. These survival-promoting responses to LPS were assessed in young chickens that had been treated with doses of ritanserin ranging from 0 to 2.7 mg/kg on embryonic day 17 (E17). When sickness behavior was assessed in 5-7-day-old chicks 1 h post-LPS injection, E17 ritanserin-treated subjects did not differ from controls. At 4-6 h post-LPS, 4-day-old chicks displayed a robust fever, and E17 ritanserin did not affect the magnitude of this response. Similarly, E17 ritanserin treatment failed to affect corticosterone concentrations 2 h post-LPS in 14-day-old chicks. Thus, ritanserin treatment during late embryogenesis, a time when it is effective against direct and indirect acting 5-HT2 agonists, failed to modify the survival promoting and beneficial interactions between the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems that are elicited following immunostimulation.

Two palearctic pas serine birds, the brambling (Fringilla montifringilla) and the common redpoll (Carduelis f. flammea), which both breed during summer at latitudes above the Arctic Circle and migrate to temperate zone latitudes for wintering, were studied. To investigate the effect of daily alterations in light spectrum, bramblings were tested under 24-h cycles of fluorescent lights of different color temperatures (12 h at ca 5,000 K and 12 h at ca 2,500 K) and energy ratios varying between 16:1 and 0.3:1. Entrainment bf activity rhythms occurred at energy ratios of 1:1 (in all seven birds tested) and 0.8:1 (in three of seven birds tested) with activity mostly within the ""blue"" phase (ca 5,000 K). Light cycles alternating between narrow spectral ranges of blue (max. at 440 nm) and red (max. at 650 nm) and energy ratios of 1:1 and 1.1:1 (equivalent to ratios of photons flux of ca 0.67:1 and 0.73:1, respectively) were also effective in entraining the bramblings' activity rhythms (8 and 9 of 11 birds, respectively) with activity occurring primarily during the red phase. The activity rhythms of most common redpolls tested also entrained to blue:red light cycles (B:R 16.5:7.5 h) with equal energies during the blue and red phase (equivalent to a photons flux ratio of ca 0.67:1). The results support the hypothesis that passerine birds breeding in the arctic during summer may use the daily changes in spectal composition of sunlight as a zeitgeber for synchronizing physiological and behavioral rhythms, if changes in light intensity are not a reliable environmental cue.

Chick survival was negatively associated with genetic relatedness of mates, This may imply that more chicks die when genetic relatedness of mates is high, i.e. low chick heterozygosity at hatching. Hence, newly hatched chicks with low heterozygosity may have reduced viability and, therefore, might suffer higher mortality due to biotic/abiotic conditions. However, there was no association between the proportion of chicks with low heterozygosity and ambient temperature, but a highly significant association with predation pressure was found. Because newly hatched chicks are unable to maintain their body temperature even at normal ambient temperatures and because willow ptarmigan chicks start chirping when they get cold, it is suggested that chicks with low genetic variation may become more exposed to predation, It is proposed that genetic variation significantly affects viability of ptarmigan chicks, but that predation is the proximate cause of death. Consistent with several earlier studies, predation was related both to nesting females and to survival of the chicks. However, the present study extends these findings by suggesting a relationship between predation on one side and genetic constitution on the other, and that predation on nesting females, by reducing genetic variation among chicks at hatching, enhance chick mortality.";"chick survival; genetics; Lagopus lagopus; predation; temperature; willow ptarmigan";1999;"WILDLIFE BIOLOGY";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The causes of these fluctuations, however, remain controversial, but several studies have emphasised the effect of predation. Predation not only reduces the number of breeding birds, but does it in such a way that genetic variation among chicks at hatching becomes reduced, causing reduced viability and increased mortality among chicks. We present an extended predation hypothesis in which the multiannually fluctuating population dynamics of the willow ptarmigan are better explained by a model including both predation and genetic variation of territorial nesting females than by predation alone. A simple model including the heterozygosity of nesting territorial females and the percentage of females suffering egg predation explained 95% of the observed fluctuations in chick production on an inland study area during five years, whereas predation alone only explained 72%. The data may suggest a non-additive relationship between predation and genetic variation of nesting females which enhance the effect of predation. Observed and calculated chick production per two adults deviated on average by only 0.38 chicks. In another inland population, showing multiannual fluctuations for almost 20 years, observed and calculated chick production deviated on average by 0.58 chicks, and the model explained 61% of observed fluctuations in chick production, whereas predation alone only explained 28%. In an island population, however, the full model explained 45% of observed fluctuations in chick production. This was about the same as predation alone (44%). It is discussed whether the better fit of the full model than the model including predation alone between observed and calculated chick production obtained in the two inland populations in contrast to the island population, may be caused by the different predator communities.";"fluctuations; genetics; Lagopus lagopus; predation; willow ptarmigan";1999;"WILDLIFE BIOLOGY";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Competition with the red fox Vulpes vulpes has frequently been suggested as a possible factor hindering arctic fox recovery. Between 1988 and 1997, a total of 213 former arctic fox dens in four alpine regions of Norway, i.e. Hardangervidda, Dovrefjell, Borgefjell and Dividalen, were checked at least once for occupation by red or arctic foxes. Of these 213 former arctic fox dens, 138 were unoccupied, and 32 and 43 were occupied by arctic and red foxes, respectively. In general, red foxes occupied dens situated at significantly lower altitudes than those occupied by arctic foxes, which supports present ideas of red fox/arctic fox coexistence. As arctic foxes tended to avoid dens at the lowest altitudes, it is possible that arctic foxes to some degree avoid the areas where red foxes are most abundant. This may have disproportionate effects, as the probability of reproduction in arctic fox dens was highest in dens at lower altitudes. Despite this, the large number of unoccupied dens indicates that dens are unlikely to be in limited supply. Therefore, neither our data, nor a review of published data and trapping records, support the hypothesis that inter-specific competition with the red fox is currently preventing arctic fox recovery in the Norwegian alpine environment.";"Alopex lagopus; arctic fox; den; inter-specific competition; population decline; red fox; Vulpes vulpes";1999;"WILDLIFE BIOLOGY";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Although 686,000 ha of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) grasslands have been added to the western Kansas landscape since 1985, pheasant populations have not recovered. Summer observations suggested that CRP was used proportionally more by pheasant broods than indicated by its relative availability. Overwinter pheasant use of CRP (a habitat gained) averaged just 37% of that in weedy wheat stubble (a habitat being lost). Widespread deterioration of abundant wheat stubble habitats, largely from increased herbicide use, represents an overwhelming habitat loss in western Kansas for which CRP could not compensate. In addition, anticipated pheasant benefits from CRP were not fully realized due to inadequate plant diversity, poor stand maintenance, and large field size. The habitat value of established CRP can be enhanced by strip-disking fireguards around the margins of fields to facilitate occasional controlled burns, stimulate growth of broad-leaved annuals, and increase edge. Interseeding perennial legumes and other forbs into recently burned grass stands also can be effective. Interspersion of grass-legume strips on intensively farmed croplands through the continuous signup of CRP offers great potential to improve pheasant habitat.";"Conservation Reserve Program; CRP; Kansas; Phasianus colchicus; pheasant; population; ring-necked pheasant; stubble; wheat; habitat";1999;"WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN";"Biodiversity Conservation";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Through observation and experimentation, we investigated the interactions between ghost crabs and plovers on Wild Beach, a Piping Plover nesting area on Assateague Island, Virginia. This site has a high abundance of ghost crabs and historically low hedging success compared to adjacent areas with fewer crabs. We observed encounters of crabs with plover eggs, chicks, and adults in the field, but never predation. In staged encounters of crabs with eggs and chicks (using hatchery reared quail as plover surrogates), we were unable to elicit predatory behavior either on the beach or in the lab. We conclude that although instances of ghost crab predation on Piping Plover eggs and chicks occur, they are rare and cannot account for the high mortality frequently reported on beaches where ghost crabs are abundant. Adult plovers behave toward crabs as if they were dangerous to eggs and chicks, and their young broods in the study area did not forage along the foreshore. Hence, ghost crabs may increase mortality indirectly. Frequent responding to crabs by parents may attract more deadly brood predators. Brood nutrition may suffer as adult plovers direct chicks away from areas where forage is reportedly richer but crabs are abundant, such as the foreshore. Nutrient intake may be further reduced on more southerly breeding grounds where high temperatures on backshores force chicks to stop foraging and take shelter during mid-day. Although high mortality cannot be attributed directly to predation by crabs, it may be due to factors that covary with crab abundance, such as high temperature, behavioral responses of adult birds, and poor forage.";NA;1999;"WILSON BULLETIN";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

How valid is this assumption? Studies on wading birds have been central to the application of dispersion models to predator-prey systems. However, these birds do not always attempt to maximize their rate of energy intake, implying that maximization involves costs as well as benefits. Overwintering oystercatchers feeding on cockles in the Burry Inlet, South Wales, do not consume the larger more energetically profitable cockles even though consuming these prey would increase their rate of energy intake. This paper tests the hypothesis that maximizing energy intake involves a trade-off with exposure to helminth parasites. Cockles are important intermediate hosts for helminth parasites, for which oystercatchers are the definitive host. The helminth intensity of cockles increased significantly with cockle size. A functional response model was used to examine how size selection by the birds influenced energy intake and the ingestion rate of parasites. To maximize energy intake birds should selectively consume the larger size classes, but to minimize the ingestion rate of parasites they should consume the smallest size classes. In the wild, birds selectively consumed intermediate size classes, which could represent a compromise between these conflicting demands.

We investigated whether early exposure to nonaversive odorants altered the responses of 1-day-old chicks to a number of odorants from naturalistic sources, including feathers and faeces of adult chickens, wood litter and food (chick starter mash). The odorants were delivered by dynamic olfactometry, in which air containing different concentrations of each odorant was presented separately to individually housed chicks together with a small, coloured bead at which they could peck. When tested with a faecal odorant, but not the other odorants, control chicks, incubated and reared under standard conditions, shook their heads more but their pecking responses did not vary for any of the odorants tested. Chicks that had been exposed to a moist-food odorant from embryonic day 20 to 18 h posthatching and tested with odorants from either moist or dry food pecked less than controls but shook their heads the same amount. Early exposure to the moist-food odorant did not affect responses to the odorants of feathers or faeces. Chicks apparently learn about their olfactory environment during the later part of incubation and in the early posthatching period and the memory formed alters behaviour on day 1 posthatching.

First, changes in one demographic rate can change the qualitative ranking of the elasticity values calculated from a population matrix, a result that dampens enthusiasm for ranking conservation actions based solely on which rates have the highest elasticity values. Second, although elasticities often provide accurate predictions of future changes in population growth rate under management perturbations that are large or that affect more than one rate concurrently, concordance frequently fails when different rates vary by different amounts. In particular, when vital rates change to their high or low values observed in nature, predictions of future growth rate based on elasticities of a mean matrix can be misleading, even predicting population increase when the population growth rate actually declines following a perturbation.

Experiment 1 examined the effect of a variety of doses of naloxone, an opioid antagonist, on chicks administered isotonic or hypertonic solution. Plasma osmolality in chicks administered hypertonic solution was significantly higher than that in groups administered isotonic solution. None of the doses of naloxone affected plasma osmolality in response to isotonic and hypertonic solution. Plasma levels of AVT increased in hypertonic solution and this response was further enhanced by naloxone injection as the doses increased. The hypertonic solution alone did not affect plasma levels of MT, but additional treatment with naloxone slightly increased plasma levels of MT. Experiment 2 examined the effect of DAMGO ([D-Ala(2),N-Me-Phe(4), Gly-ol]-enkephalin), a specific mu receptor agonist. Relatively high plasma osmolality caused by hypertonic solution was not affected by additional treatment with DAMGO. Plasma levels of AVT in response to hypertonic solution and to additional treatment with naloxone were reduced by higher doses of DAMGO. Experiment 3 examined the effect of naloxone on chicks administered different concentrations of NaCl. Administration of hypertonic solution resulted in an increase in plasma osmolality and plasma levels of AVT. Naloxone administration enhanced the increase in plasma AVT levels in response to hypertonic solution. Experiment 4 examined the effect of naloxone on different kinds of hypertonic solution, 0.15 M NaCl, 1.5 M NaCl, 2.55 M urea, and 1.95 M sucrose. The increases in plasma osmolality resulting from the administration of the urea and sucrose solutions were the same as those in the chicks injected with 1.5 M NaCl. In sucrose-treated chicks, plasma levels of AVT increased in chicks administered naloxone but not in chicks injected with normal saline. In contrast, no;significant changes in plasma levels of AVT were observed in urea treatment with or without naloxone. In Experiments 3 and 4, plasma levels of MT after administration of hypertonic solutions did not change. However, naloxone administration enhanced plasma levels of MT in osmotically stimulated chicks. The results of the present study suggest that opioid peptides attenuate the increase in plasma AVT and MT in hypertonic states.

A recent analysis showed that the survival and breeding success of female hen harriers were much lower on grouse moors than on other upland land management classes in Scotland, excluding the Orkney islands: a difference attributed to persecution of hen barriers by humans on grouse moors. However, this study did not look for possible beneficial effects on hen harrier breeding success of the control by moorland gamekeepers of other predators, particularly red foxes. 2. These and other recently published data were re-examined to see whether there was regional variation in hen harrier nest success associated with the presence or absence of foxes and the control of foxes and other predators by moorland gamekeepers. 3. The main finding of the previous analysis, that nest success was much lower on grouse moors than on moorland that was not managed for grouse or in young conifer forests, was even more striking when comparisons were made among land management classes within the same region. 4. The mean number of broods fledged per female hen harrier per year on two grouse moors at which gamekeepers prevented human interference with harrier nests and continued to control other predators was compared with the average for moorland in Scotland. Harrier productivity on these moors was much higher than the average for grouse moors, but similar to the average for moorland not managed for grouse shooting. 5. Nest success of hen harriers breeding on moorland not managed for grouse averaged 19% higher in regions where there were, on average, more grouse moors in the vicinity, but in young conifer forests success was 34% lower in regions with more grouse moors nearby. Neither of these differences was statistically significant. 6. Nest success within a particular land management class was not significantly different inside and outside the range of the red fox. 7.

This study reviews critically evidence for morphological plasticity of the gastro-intestinal system of vertebrates. Structural flexibility of the gastro-intestinal tract has been described for 31 bird species, nine mammals, one snake, one frog, and one fish. While these numbers do not give conclusive information about the overall systematic distribution of this phenomenon, they do reflect on the focus of research correlating organismal function to phenotypic transformations, i.e., comparative ecology in birds and gastrointestinal physiology in mammals. As a general pattern, food quality and energetic demands (i.e., reproduction, exercise, temperature stress) affect size and structure of the avian and mammalian gastro-intestinal tract. Such structural responses occur within a few days. However, only few studies clearly examine the dynamics, direction, and repeatability of these structural transformations. Almost all studies consider increase in of organ size and function while decrease in these factors has been neglected to date. Clear evidence for repeatable, directional, and fast structural flexibility comes from studies of Japanese quail, laboratory mice, and Burmese python. Studies concerning other species are mostly observational or do not systematically test for repeatability and directionality of responses. Ecological studies have sparked the search for structural flexibility, but many of these studies, particularly in birds, do not clearly separate between possible circannual endogenously controlled changes of organ size and phenotypic responses to changes in environment. Only integrative ecological and experimental studies of vertebrates will distinguish between endogenous pattern and phenotypic response. Our yet rather static understanding of structures may then translate into a more dynamic approach and we may grasp the meaning of flexibility as an 'envelope' that allows for fine-tuning of structures and functions to their actual demands.";"phenotypic plasticity; morphometry; functional morphology; phenotypic transformations; diet switching";1999;"ZOOLOGISCHER ANZEIGER";"Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

For plants that cannot respond to grazing damage by compensatory shoot growth, periodic production of toxins can have an adaptive advantage at the individual level. Several plants in the diet of cyclical small mammals do produce lethal toxins and some production is known to be cyclical. Despite the wealth of indirect and anecdotal observation in support of the hypothesis, there remains a lacuna in the hard core of evidence: periodic production of lethal toxins and toxin-related deaths in microtines. We argue that this is only because it has not been sought among likely plants or has been sought at the wrong place or time. Strong candidate species are non-preferred foods with circumpolar distributions such as Empetrum nigrum or Vaccinium uliginosum. The right place to expect lethal toxin production is the high altitude or latitude epicentres of population crashes, in regions where recovery is by immigration as well as births; the right time is at the cusp of the crash. We propose an experimental design to test the hypothesis.

We established the patterns of nest attendance during egg laying and the start of incubation in ring-necked pheasants, Phasianus colchicus, and tested three hypotheses regarding the advantage of early incubation. To determine nest attendance, we measured egg temperatures in real pheasant nests. Females spent more time on the nest as laying progressed, with an average of 6.4 h at a clutch size of 10. At the start of incubation, nest attendance increased to over 20 h/day. On the day before full incubation, time spent on the nest was positively correlated with the female's condition and negatively with the number of breeding attempts she had already made that season. The hypothesis that an early start of incubation improves egg viability was rejected, as the predicted relationship between the number of eggs laid after the start of incubation and the number laid before the start of incubation was not significant. We also rejected the possibility that early incubation reduces the risk of nest parasitism, as it was negatively related to the number of females radiotracked around the nest. Our data supported the hypothesis that early incubation reduces the risk of nest predation by shortening the period of exposure, as the number of eggs laid after incubation started was positively related to the number of breeding attempts made by the female, and thus to the perceived predation risk, but was negatively related to the time of season.

The time taken by 2-day-old chicks to traverse a T maze and thereby regain visual contact with their companions was measured. Chicks were categorized according to whether they completed this task quickly (HP, high performance, <25 s) or slowly (LP, low performance, >75 s) and then housed in same-category groups, each of eight chicks. In experiment 1, we compared the numbers of HP and LP chicks showing certain home cage behaviours (ambulation, standing, resting, maintenance, pecking, preening). No significant differences were found. In experiment 2, we compared the behaviour of HP and LP chicks in two tests of sociality (homecage proximity, runway) and in two tests of fear (emergence, tonic immobility). The HP chicks stayed closer together in the home cage than did their LP counterparts and they spent significantly longer near a goal;box containing conspecifics in the runway than did LP ones. Conversely, there were no significant differences between HP and LP chicks in their latency to emerge from a sheltered area into an exposed and, hence, potentially frightening one or in their tonic immobility fear reactions. These findings suggest that;contrasting T-maze performance was unlikely to have reflected differences in underlying activity levels or in fearfulness. Conversely, individual variation in underlying sociality was probably an influential variable.

Pigeons kept individually under ad libitum feeding conditions in the laboratory do not suffer lethal poisoning because they develop a strong avoidance response to fonofos-treated seed, which restricts consumption to below lethal levels. Two laboratory experiments were conducted to assess the role of avoidance in reducing the risk of acute poisoning of captive birds under food stress. In the first experiment, pigeons acclimatized to feed on untreated wheat seeds for 6 h/day were presented with fonofos-treated seeds for 6 h on a testing day, following normal food surplus in one experimental group (eight birds) and 6 days of deprivation in another (eight birds). In the second experiment, different pigeons were acclimatized to a feeding regime of 2 h/day and treated seeds were offered without previous restriction (eight birds) or after 6 days of food restriction in which birds were given 15% of normal intake (eight birds). In the second experiment, six birds in each experimental group were video-taped to study their feeding behavior. Survivors at the end of the testing day were killed, and all birds were dissected and analyzed to determine carcass and pectoral muscle composition. Food-stressed birds lost similar to 11% of their initial body weight during 6 days of total or partial food restriction, but they still had visible fat deposits and a high body fat content, indicating that they were in good body condition in terms of energy reserves. Consumption of treated seeds on the testing day was reduced in comparison with normal intake of untreated seed in all birds, but there were differences between experimental groups. In ad libitum-fed birds, consumption of treated seed in each experiment averaged 12% and 19% of normal levels, exposure to fonofos was below lethal levels, and no bird died. In food-stressed birds, consumption was higher (34% or 56% of normal levels for the first and second experiments, respectively) and led to the ingestion of seed containing lethal doses of pesticide. Two birds in the first experiment and three in the second died of acute poisoning within around 2 h of initial exposure. The avoidance response developed quickly in both ad libitum-fed and food-stressed birds. Feeding took place in most birds almost exclusively in the first 9 min of the testing day. Within this interval, birds of the two experimental groups stopped ingesting treated seeds around 6 min after the onset of feeding. The differences between experimental groups in consumption of treated seed were due to the higher feeding rate and effective feeding time in food-stressed birds. It is concluded that although feral pigeons under severe food stress develop an early and strong conditioned food aversion to fonofos-treated seeds, avoidance does not always prevent mortality.

Once a link between a steroid hormone and a behavioral response has been established, one can use the localization of steroid hormone receptors in the brain to facilitate the identification of neural circuits that control behavior. The recent identification of a second type of estrogen receptor called estrogen receptor beta or ER beta has raised new issues about the action of steroid hormones in the brain. A hypothesis has been proposed by Kuiper et al. [1998] based on studies in mammalian species suggesting that ER alpha (the name given to the ER that was previously described) is important for reproduction while ER beta is more important for non-reproductive functions. In this paper we apply this hypothesis more generally by examining possible functions of ER beta in avian species. We have initiated studies of the ERP in the brain of two avian species, the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) and the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris). ER beta was cloned in both species and the mRNA for this receptor type was localized in the brain employing in situ hybridization histochemistry methods. In both species ER beta was found to be diffusely present in telencephalic areas consistent with a role for this receptor subtype in cognitive functions. However, ER beta mRNA was also found in many brain areas that are traditionally thought to be important in the regulation of reproductive functions such as the preoptic region, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the nucleus taeniae. Of the two receptor types, only mRNA for ER alpha was observed in the telencephalic vocal control nucleus HVc of male starlings. Steroid receptors in this nucleus are thought to be an example of an evolutionary specialization that has evolved to coordinate the production of courtship vocalizations with other aspects of reproduction. The lack of ER beta mRNA expression in HVc is consistent with the hypothesis that ER alpha is preferentially involved in reproductive behaviors while ER beta is involved in the steroid regulation of other neural functions. However, the widespread occurrence of ER beta in other nuclei involved in reproductive function suggests that one must be cautious about the general applicability of the above hypothesis until more is known about ER beta function in these other nuclei.";"Japanese quail; European starling; androgen receptor; estrogen receptor-beta; songbird; testosterone; estrogen; reproductive behavior";1999;"BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND EVOLUTION";"Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

To test our hypotheses we distinguished the broods of white storks Ciconia ciconia L. where chicks died and those where all chicks survived, We analysed the plasma testosterone concentrations in the chicks, the ability of the chicks to be first to receive food and the mass of chicks before fledging in relation to their hatching order and recorded the body mass of parents and food mass delivered by them. Female storks used the asymmetries in testosterone concentrations within a brood to control brood size and adjusted the number of young hatched to match the parental ability to rear offspring. Females of poor condition altered the testosterone concentrations to produce large differences between the chicks: The first-hatched chicks, which had high plasma testosterone levels, responded faster to the feeding parent and received more food than did their younger siblings. One or two later-hatched chicks, which had lower testosterone levels, died in these broods. Females in good condition produced small differences in testosterone concentrations between the chicks and all chicks survived in their brood. Chicks that were raised by the females of poor condition in reduced broods were heavier than chicks that were raised by females of good condition in broods where all chicks survived.

We examined the effect of fall either-sex hunting on survival of radiotagged female wild turkeys from 1989 to 1994 in Virginia and West Virginia. We tested the hypothesis that survival of female wild turkeys did not differ among areas closed to fall hunting, open to a 4-week fall season, or open to an 8- or 9-week fall hunting season. Mean annual survival rates were higher in the area closed to fall hunting than in regions where fall hunting occurred (P = 0.05). Mean annual survival rates varied within years (P less than or equal to 0.05). Differences in annual survival rate among areas were attributed to legal hunting (P less than or equal to 0.01).

Juvenile, yearling, and adult hens had similar survival rates in the areas closed to fall hunting and with 4 weeks of fall hunting (P = 0.39), but survival rates of juveniles were lower (P = 0.03) than those of yearling and adult females in the area with an 8-9-week fall hunting season.

We used data from 288 nests of radiomarked female pheasants during the 1990-94 breeding seasons in Iowa to study nest-site selection and nest success. We quantified habitat and landscape metrics within the 485-m radius of a home range around nests by using aerial imagery and FRAGSTATS. We screened potential landscape variables by using principal component and classification and regression tree (CART) analyses before developing logistic regression models to predict nest-site selection and success as a function of landscape conditions. A 5-variable logistic regression model incorporating nesting patch size, mean grassland patch size, landscape core area, landscape shape index, and distance to edge predicted nest-site locations at a 77% posterior concordant rate. The CART analyses suggested nest success was best modeled by splitting nest observations into nests in patches less than or equal to 15.6 ha and >15.6 ha. For nests in patches less than or equal to 15.6 ha, a logistic regression model with site cover type and mean core area index predicted nest success with a 73% posterior concordant rate (P < 0.001). For nests in patches >15.6 ha, a model with site cover type, core area standard deviation, and distance from the nest to the edge predicted nest success best (concordant rate = 64%, P = 0.069), although the effect of distance of edge was very slight (conditional odds ratio = 1.003, 95% CI = 0.997-1.009). Our models suggest managers should strive to provide undisturbed grassland blocks greater than or equal to 15 ha for nesting pheasants, but our observation was the success was highest in fields 4 times that size.

Song control nuclei are larger during the breeding season, as determined by multiple cytological labels. Seasonal changes in song nuclei are regulated by testosterone (T), and several song nuclei contain intracellular androgen receptors (AR). Changes in AR levels may interact with changes in plasma T levels to regulate song nuclei morphology. We measured seasonal changes in AR-immunoreactive cells in the telencephalic song nucleus HVc using the affinity-purified PG21 antibody to rat AR. We caught wild adult male Gambel's white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii) during spring breeding in Alaska and during autumn migration in Washington State. To enhance PG21 labeling, animals were treated with T for 90 minutes (as in Smith et al. [1996] J. Histochem. Cytochem. 44:1075-1080). AR+ cells were found in HVc and other song nuclei, hippocampus, nucleus taeniae (homologue to mammalian amygdala), and the hypothalamus.

In spring, but not autumn, PG21 and Nissl measurements were slightly different (PG21:Nissl = 1.07), perhaps because PG21 labeled the most caudal extent of HVc more clearly. In HVc, AR+ cell density and number were greater in spring. The percentage of AR+ cells was also increased in spring. Qualitatively, the staining intensity of individual cells was higher in spring. In time course studies, the T injection enhanced PG21 staining within 15 minutes, suggesting that it increases labeling via AR translocation to and concentration in the cell nucleus.

The two zones of torsion were each associated with bending; between them was a torsion-free zone that tended to be straight.

Chicks made one detour trial, and were then retested after delays of 30 min, 3 h and 24 h. When retested, the chicks took significantly less time to make the detour, even at 24 h. Chicks that failed to solve the task on the first trial within the time limit (600 s) took as long as naive chicks, when tested again 24 h later, suggesting that long-term memory for the task requires a form of one-trial learning. Since many chicks chose the same direction of detour on both the first trial and the retest, they may have simply shown a stereotyped preferential response. In a further experiment to test this possibility, we used a more complex version of the apparatus: the direction of detour first chosen by the chick was: always blocked, and a subsequent detour in the opposite direction was required to complete the task. This time, chicks did not choose the same direction on the first test and when tested 24 h later. However, they proved able to remember the correct direction for at least 24 h if they were allowed to learn the correct path in a series of five trials.

However, the factors influencing VIP secretion, and hence prolactin release, in birds remain largely unexplored, Recent evidence has demonstrated that dopamine and dopamine receptors may affect VIP and prolactin release in birds, The differential expression of dopamine receptors on hypothalamic VIP-releasing neurons may affect the degree of prolactinemia observed during the reproductive cycle of birds. In order to examine this hypothesis, we used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to quantitate the levels of D1 and D2 dopamine receptor subtype mRNAs in the brain of the domestic turkey hen during the reproductive cycle, No significant difference in hypothalamic expression of D1 or D2 dopamine receptor subtypes during the reproductive cycle was observed, However, pronounced differences in D1, and D2 mRNAs were detected in cortex and cerebellum, Interestingly, there was a dramatic increase in pituitary D1, receptor mRNA during the reproductive stages of laying and incubation of eggs, which paralleled the hyperprolactinemic state of the turkey reproductive cycle.

Revealing and mapping spatial patterns of genetic diversity within species' ranges may be vital when defining criteria and prioritizing areas for conservation. Chukar Partridges (Alectoris chukar) in Israel occur along a steep ecogeographical gradient extending from mesic Mediterranean zones in the north to steppe and desert regions in the south. To rest the hypothesis that the most genetically diverse populations within a species' range occur within the ecotone, an area of transition between ecosystems where a sharp environmental gradient exists, we examined the allozyme diversity of chukars collected at five locations within the species' continuous range in each of 2 years. Based on 32 allozyme loci, the genetic diversity of chukars increased significantly, along a gradient from population in Mediterranean regions to those at the ecotone in the northern Negev desert, despite close geographical proximity among populations Genetic diversity As estimated by percent polymorphic loci, observed and expected heterozygosity, and mean number of alleles was not homogeneous among sampling localities: single and multilocus Hardy-Weinberg and linkage disequilibria increased along the gradient toward the ecotone. Populations exhibited some isolation by distance effects in the face of substantial gene flow. We therefore recommend that higher conservation priority be assigned to the Mediterranean-Negev ecotone area. For Chukar Partridges, it supports the highest overall genetic diversity across ecological gradients.

Heather plants were exposed to T. tenuis larvae in the laboratory and kept under suitable conditions for larval migration. Few larvae were found in dew droplets or concealed within heather leaflets; most larvae were recovered from the plant surface. This suggests that the low larval recovery from vegetation in the field simply reflects a highly aggregated distribution of few larvae. In a second experiment, the efficiency with which infective larvae migrate up the structurally complex heather plants was compared with migration up two control plant species with simpler structures: a monocotyledon, wheat, and a dicotyledon, hebe.

Eleven pairs of farms in central and southern Sweden were chosen. One farm in each pair was sprayed normally (i.e. 90-100% of cereal fields were treated annually with herbicides; insecticides and fungicides were only used after pest and disease thresholds had been exceeded), whilst on the other farm the outer six metres of crop of several cereal fields received no pesticides. In each year, unsprayed crop margins in both autumn- and spring-sown cereals had significantly higher percentages of weed cover. Unsprayed crop margins supported higher densities of nontarget arthropods, particularly the non-pest species which are important in the diet of insect-eating gamebird chicks. Significant positive relationships were observed between the densities of these insects and the degree of weed cover. Mean brood sizes and chick survival rates of both grey partridges Perdix perdix and pheasants Phasianus colchicus were higher on farms with unsprayed crop margins. The effects of omitting herbicide (pesticide) treatments were most dramatic for grey partridges.

This cDNA clone has an open reading frame of 1,311 base pairs encoding a 436-residue protein with seven transmembrane-spanning domains and exhibits high homology with previously cloned mammalian D2 dopamine receptors. Northern blot, analysis of turkey brain mRNA detected an approximate 2.4-kb transcript. RT-PCR and subsequent nucleotide sequence analysis of turkey brain and peripheral tissue mRNA also demonstrated the presence of an alternatively spliced mRNA corresponding to the predicted D2 short isoform. RT-PCR experiments demonstrated a widespread distribution of alternatively spliced D2 dopamine receptor transcripts throughout the turkey brain and in select peripheral tissues as well. In situ hybridization experiments detected strong autoradiographic signals over much of the turkey telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, cerebellum, pituitary, and pineal gland. Dopamine has several important functions as a neurotransmitter and hormone in mammals and may have similar actions in avian species.

Bright plumage in males is commonly thought to arise as a result of sexual selection by females such that males with bright coloration possess high fitness. However, bright plumage potentially could expose males to increased predation risk. Consistent with this idea, males of many highly dichromatic passerine species do not incubate. I tested whether brightly-colored males avoid incubation to reduce the probability of visual predators locating their nest. This hypothesis predicts greater hatching success for clutches incubated by cryptically-colored individuals than by brightly-colored individuals. The Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) is a common dichromatic species that breeds throughout the eastern U.S. I placed two button-quail (Turnix sp.) eggs in each of 203 simulated cardinal nests. Dull brown cardboard, simulating a female cardinal, was placed over about half of all clutches. Bright red cardboard, simulating a male cardinal, was placed over the other clutches. Nest success was highest for well-concealed nests (87%) and lowest for nests in open habitat (54%). Nests containing red cardboard did not have significantly lower success than nests with brown cardboard, nor did I detect a significant color x vegetation-density interaction.

Both E and P rose sharply to maxima 1 day before the first egg was laid. Thereafter, E steadily declined, but P remained high through 2 days after the first egg was laid, after which both hormones had returned to low levels. Clutch size did not explain variation in E or P output during the laying cycle. When analyzed with respect to onset of incubation, E and, to a lesser extent, P dropped significantly on the day incubation began, irrespective of whether or not females had finished ovulating. We suggest that factors initiating incubation also cause the decline in E production by small follicles, which in turn may inhibit yolk sequestration in large follicles.

Males and females were trapped and sampled once between laying of the first and the second eggs in the clutch. The transient capture and sampling did not disrupt incubation or the timing of the subsequent oviposition. Ages ranged from 2 to 21 years, with most in the range 4-11 years. There was a strong inverse correlation (P < 0.0001) between age and laying date in both females and males, with older birds nesting earlier in the season. Plasma LH levels increased (P < 0.005) among mature (>5 year) females. Plasma progesterone and E2 were positively correlated with each other among mature females, but did not change in an age-dependent manner. In males, plasma progesterone levels showed no age-related changes. However, maturing (3-5 year) males showed increasing plasma androgen levels (P < 0.01); mature males showed no change with age. Plasma UH levels were correlated with androgen levels in both maturing and mature males. Plasma progesterone declined with age in maturing males (P < 0.001). These data provide evidence for changing endocrine status with age, but the patterns differ for younger individuals (less than or equal to 5 year) and mature birds. It appears that in younger individuals, nesting experience and maturity of the pair affect reproductive performance and endocrine status. Individual variability was high for all hormones, possibly masking age-related changes. Only breeding individuals were sampled at all ages, although the proportion of the population that continues to reproduce may decline as the birds age. In summary, common terns continue to breed successfully until at least age 21 years and these individuals maintain relatively stable endocrine status during aging. Although there was some indication of declines in estradiol and androgens among the oldest birds (1.6-21 years), these declines were not statistically significant and were manifested in only a small fraction (<4%) of the breeding population.

Males (M) and females (F) were assigned a breeding history that was 'experienced' (E) or 'inexperienced' (I), depending on whether they were part of a pair that had hatched at least one egg during the past two breeding trials. Re-pairing resulted in four groups designated EMEF, EMIF, IMEF, and IMIF. Nesting success was defined as incidence of, or latency to, nest inspection, nest-bowl formation, and egg laying, as well as hatchability of eggs. Additionally, age, pre-laying nestbox occupancy, and relative cage height were evaluated for relationship to nesting success. Eight weeks after re-pairing, birds were exposed to environmental stimuli for breeding, and nestboxes were checked daily for evidence of nest inspection, bowl formation, oviposition, and hatching. Videocameras recorded nestbox occupancy for 4 h every other day. Overall, groups differed significantly in the number of pairs that inspected nests and formed bowls; nest inspection was lowest for LMIF, and bowl formation was highest for EMEF. When groups were combined based on male breeding history, significantly more EM than IM inspected nests and formed bowls. Comparing groups based on female breeding history, significantly more EF than IF inspected nests and formed bowls. Only EF laid eggs, and mates of EF's that laid spent significantly more pre-lay time in the nestbox than did mates of EF's that didn't lay.

Since Hamilton's theoretical work in the 1960s it has been realized that social behaviour may evolve through the effects of kinship. By helping relatives, an individual may pass on its genes despite negative effects on its own reproduction. Leks are groups of males that females visit primarily to mate. The selective advantage for males to join such social groups has been given much recent attention, but no clear picture has yet emerged. Here we show, using microsatellite analysis, that males but not females of a lekking bird (the black grouse, Tetrao tetrix) are genetically structured at the lek level. We interpret this structuring to be the effects of strong natal philopatry in males. This has the consequence that males on any specific lek should be more related than expected by chance as indicated by our genetic data. Our results thus suggest that kin selection is a factor that needs to be considered in the evolution and maintenance of the lek mating system in black grouse and sheds new light on models of lek evolution.";"leks; genetic structure; microsatellites; kin selection; social evolution";1999;"PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES";"Biology; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The hybrids and most of the allopatric populations were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, but six populations near the hybrid zone showed a significant deficit of heterozygotes. The partridges in the hybrid zone included F-1 hybrids, backcrosses, and other recombinant genotypes. This hybrid zone could result from secondary contact of formerly allopatric populations following deglaciation of the Alps, probably not before 6,000 to 8,000 years ago.

The potential for exposure to wildlife from frequent organophosphorus (OP) spray applications is therefore considerable. This study investigated the impact of agricultural spray applications of azinphos-methyl, diazinon, phosalone, and phosmet in apple orchards on the cholinesterase (ChE) activity of wild birds nesting in orchards. These four OP pesticides ranked among the most widely used insecticides used on all fruit crops in Ontario in 1988. Tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) and eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) were chosen as monitor species because they commonly breed and forage within apple orchards. utilize different feeding strategies, and are readily attracted to nest boxes. Brain and plasma ChE activities were determined for nestling bluebirds and swallows, and plasma ChE was measured in adult swallows for comparison with nestling data. In adult tree swallows, mean plasma ChE levels were significantly inhibited 41% compared to controls 12 h after a second application of azinphos-methyl. h lean plasma ChE activity in another group of adult tree swallows dropped by 21 and 19% following a multiple phosmet application. In nestlings brain ChE activities obtained postspray often fell below predicted activities calculated from control siblings. This trend was especially apparent in the younger nestlings, less than 6 d old. However, for bluebirds the rates of increase of brain ChE with age in nestlings from treated sites was significantly lower than in nestlings from control sites. Brain ChE activity of two nestlings found dead following a phosalone application gave no indication that insecticide exposure was responsible. No other dead or moribund birds were discovered during the course of the study. Sequential plasma sampling of siblings, before and after OP application, was beneficial in reducing the required number of nests sampled by one half, but plasma ChE was less reliable overall than brain ChE in indicating exposure. Results of depressed ChE levels in tree swallows and eastern bluebirds inhabiting apple orchards are consistent with avian species in other orchard monitoring studies.

There are many arthropod species on farmland that are not economic pests but which have an important role in the wider ecology of agricultural ecosystems. Few of these have been studied in detail. This study investigated the factors underlying the distribution of one such group, graminivorous sawflies (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae). 2. In a farm survey, sawfly larvae of the genera Dolerus and Pachynematus were over six times more abundant in fields of sown perennial rye-grass Lolium perenne L. than in fields of spring barley, winter wheat or long-established grazing pastures. 3. In rearing trials the growth rates and survival of larvae of the two genera were high on L, perenne and low on two cereals, spring barley and winter wheat. Differences were sufficiently marked to have had a strong influence on the distribution of larvae between crops in the field. 4. In an experimental study, nearly twice as many adults emerged from uncultivated as from cultivated ground, suggesting that disturbance of the overwintering prepupae and pupae in the soil caused about 50% extra mortality. This mortality will have reinforced the effects of host-plant requirements, suppressing sawfly numbers in annually cultivated cereal fields whilst numbers built up in less-frequently cultivated grass fields. 5. Sawfly abundance is known to have declined on farmland. Our results suggest that changes in patterns of crop rotation have been the main cause of this decline. Farming practice in Britain has moved away from mixed rotations alternating cereals with undersown grass fields. Modern intensive farms grow monocultures of cereal crops or of heavily grazed grass, both poor habitats for sawflies. 6. Increasing insecticide use in cereals has probably been only a minor influence on population abundance of sawflies as wheat and barley fields are not high-quality habitats. 7. Provision of undisturbed grassy habitats would promote the conservation of graminivorous sawflies on farmland.";"cereals; Dolerus; farming practices; Pachynematus; sawfly distribution";1999;"JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY";"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

A standard quail-year represents the number of quail-days accumulated annually by a stable population that averages 1 bird/ha on 1 October. Analysis reveals that (1) the daily energy demand for movement (walk,run, fly) is minor in comparison with the demand for thermoregulation; (2) stable populations of northern bobwhites have similar quail-day accumulations for 1 year under expected variation in hatching dates and survival rates; (3) the concept of food quality as energetically based cannot be decoupled from time, because foods with different metabolizable energy values provide equal total energy if foraging time is adjusted; and (4) variable appointment of time to foraging and nonforaging activities may have minor effects on survival rates, especially when density-dependent processes operate.

Successful clutches on the CSA were surrounded by less rangeland and more hayland at small to intermediate scales than those that were depredated (P less than or equal to 0.1). Habitat surrounding successful versus depredated clutches was similar (P > 0.1) on the RSA. Our results suggest the amount of breeding (i.e., grassland) habitat as well as its composition and distribution influenced some aspects of bobwhite survival and productivity, but habitat selection could not be used to reliably identify habitat attributes associated with higher probabilities of adult survival or clutch success. Reversing bobwhite population declines at large scales depends on identifying macrohabitat attributes that specifically influence individual fitness rather than population distributions.";"clutch success; Colinus virginianus; compositional analysis; habitat selection; Kansas; northern bobwhite; population distribution; survival";1999;"JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Nest sites had taller vegetation, greater visual obstruction, and more litter cover than random sites within habitat patches in which nests were located.

From the early 1980s through mid-1990s, intensive row-crop production was moderated by farm programs such as the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and annual set-aside, which diverted millions of hectares of cropland from production. We evaluated the survival of pheasant chicks in Illinois in relation to these recent land-use practices. Specifically our objectives were to determine if there were changes in chick survival during the 1980s and 1990s, and if there were regional differences in chick survival related to land-use practices. We observed 574 broods along transect road routes on the Sibley Study Area (SSA) in eastcentral Illinois, and 964 broods on routes throughout the pheasant range in Illinois. In spite of the increase in potential brood habitat on set-aside farmland, chick survival remained low from 1982 to 1996. For example, there was a 5-fold increase in the amount of forage legumes and small grains on the SSA from 1987-91 compared to 1975-81, with the average number of chicks per brood at 4.3 (1987-91) and 4.2 (1975-81). For survey routes throughout the Illinois pheasant range, the number of grassy fields (primarily narrow linear tracts) in 1990 was positively correlated (r(2) = 0.15, P < 0.02, n = 37) with chicks per brood, but this relation explained only 15% of the variation. The lack of improvement in chick survival in recent decades relates to the pervasive clean farming practices in the Illinois pheasant range. More over, most of the set-aside land in the Illinois pheasant range was under annual contract and seeded late to monotypic oats, which is cover of marginal value to foraging pheasant chicks.";"agriculture; broods; Conservation Reserve Program; Illinois; Phasianus colchicus; ring-necked pheasant; set-aside; survival";1999;"JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We did not record any deaths due to mammalian predators in winter or spring, and deaths through collision with power lines only affected winter, but not annual, survival rates. Cox proportional hazard modeling revealed season (autumn, winter-spring, summer) and area (hunted, nonhunted) as the only variables to affect risk of death (P < 0.001). The greatest rates of hunting mortality (0.24) and natural predation (0.32) occurred on the hunted area during autumn. Autumn survival on the hunted area (0.49) was lower (P = 0.029) that on the nonhunted areas (0.71).

We believe hunting mortality was mostly, if not totally, additive to natural mortality in our study. The population density on the hunted area did not decline as expected from the results, and we suggest that immigration from beyond the neighboring nonhunted areas was sustaining the population.

Diets of both species were dominated by euphausiids and myctophid fish, in particular Euphausia vallentini and Krefftichthys anderssoni. Prey items were those found in the region of the Polar Frontal Zone, confirming the importance of this zone to these penguins. Diets of both species before hatching of the chicks were variable between years, and differences in quantity of food brought ashore and degree of digestion of prey suggested inter-annual variation in distribution of prey resources. No dietary differences were detected in either penguin species across the breeding season, which reflected variability in diet at all stages, indicating that individual penguins foraged in separate areas. Significant differences between the two species were found, royal penguins consuming more myctophid fish and rockhopper penguins consuming more euphausiids. Differences were also found in the size class of prey items taken and the degree of digestion of food by both penguin species, indicating that prey were taken from different sectors of the ocean. It is concluded that the overlap in diet is small in individuals from these two spatially close colonies and, contrary to previous studies, indicates a separation in the resources used by both species. The contrast with previous studies is most likely a reflection of the different methods used to assess overlap and, to a lesser extent, the years and colonies in which the comparisons were made.";"penguins; diet; euphausiids; Macquarie Island";1999;"JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY";"Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We explored the reliability of response surface methodology in revealing two fundamental properties of a given population series. whether the density dependence is direct or delayed. and whether it is linear or nonlinear. This was done using simulated time series with known properties as well as a large set of real population time series. We show the importance of seeking the simplest form of the response surface among several alternatives, by fitting a set of response surfaces from simple first order to more complex second order nonlinear models to each time series. Performance of the models was judged by three methods: cross-validation, adjusted coefficient of determination, and checking residual behaviour. The results show that with proper model validation. the response surface methodology is not only capable of finding the numerical relationship between population growth rate and its size or density, bur can also be used to reliably reveal the delay in density dependence when it is of significant importance. However, judging nonlinearity on the basis of the response surface is generally not as evident. We reanalysed the data sets of urchin and Taylor and show that validated analysis leads to a somewhat smaller set of dynamical alternatives being accepted.

This study set out to explain why the helmeted guineafowl, Numida meleagris (Linnaeus 1766; Aves: Numididae) declined in the Midlands of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, an agricultural area where these birds were once abundant in savannas mixed with cultivation. Within the Midlands, the potential roles of land-use practices and pesticides were investigated. Using a grid cell approach, the distribution of 11 land-uses was mapped for 19 farms with different levels of guineafowl abundance. The edge distance between extensive and intensive agriculture was significantly associated with the presence of guineafowl. The presence of guineafowl was associated with greater land-use diversity, showing this species' preference for a mosaic of land-uses. Extensive agricultural areas were used for cover and intensive ones for food, but the adjacency of these land-uses affected access to these resources. Larger flocks (greater than or equal to 100 birds) were associated with pastures free of agro-chemicals, while smaller flocks (<100 birds) were associated with cereal lands where chemicals were used. The use of chemicals may reduce reproductive success by removing arthropods and weeds, which are critical food sources for female guineafowls and their keets during the breeding season. An inadequate grass cover for nesting may further reduce reproductive success. This study suggests that a combination of land-use spatial pattern and other factors, such as pesticide use, contributes to the decline in helmeted guineafowl populations in this intensively farmed area of South Africa.

A female may rank a mated male higher in quality than an unmated male because the former has demonstrated that he is able to attract a female. However, a prospecting female may also avoid a mated male because of the risk that she has to compete with the male's initial mate over access to copulations, breeding resources and male parental care. We studied the mate choice of female pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca, in aviaries divided into three compartments, two for males, and one for a female. A female was allowed to choose (build a nest in a nestbox) between two males after a period when she had been kept in a rage behind a one-way mirror and had presumably seen that one of the males was in the company of another female for 5 h. There was no evidence that females copied the mate choice of conspecific females, or that they avoided males that had recently been in the company of another female. Instead, females apparently chose a mate independently of others, choosing the male showing most courtship display. The latter result explains the consistency in mate choice observed when different females chose between the same pair of males in repeat trials. The ability of females to pick out the same male independently may also explain why a few males obtain most copulations in lekking species.

The project was both implemented and controlled by the local nonprofit regional corporation, which employed village researchers to interview elders and record their understandings of goose biology and habitat as related to storm surges. Although local and scientific understandings of brant behaviour generally agree on what is occurring (i.e., foraging habits, effects of past floods and coastal storm surges, and changes in nesting grounds), they do not always agree on why these changes are taking place. At the request of village researchers, interviews also documented Native residents' perception of non-Native research and regulation in the coastal wetlands. Elders articulated a fundamental conflict between the Yup'ik view of geese as nonhuman persons and the non-Native view of geese as manageable wildlife, and they expressed deep resentment toward the nonlocal control that researchers and wildlife managers represent. Many feel that local control of their land and their lives is more in jeopardy than the geese. Moreover, respect for elders is as important as respect for animals in affecting management processes at the community level, creating potential conflict which younger Yup'ik men and women with training in biology find difficult to resolve. Along with articulating resistance to control, elders' testimony presents possible solutions to this contentious issue, solutions founded on personal relations between community members and scientists. Villagers' statements reflect their view that how non-Natives work in the area is as important as what is accomplished.

By early May, males were on the study area, mostly in flocks numbering in the tens and hundreds. Females arrived two to three weeks later, about one week after males had dispersed and established territories. All males succeeded in establishing a territory, but only 83% were successful in attracting a mate. There were no unmated females. All but one male were monogamous. The initiation of laying was highly synchronous both within and between years, beginning shortly after ground snow cover receded below 50% (early June). Initiation of laying and clutch size were not correlated with either pre-incubation body weight or wing chord of females. The majority (71%) of hens that deserted or had their first nest depredated during laying renested. However, renesting was rare once incubation had commenced. Clutch size of first nests (mean = 8.7) was significantly larger than that of renests (mean = 5.0). In one year, adults laid larger clutches than yearlings; this did not result, however, in adults' fledging larger broods than yearlings that year. Pooling yeats, yearling females were as successful as adults: the proportion of first nests initiated that fledged was 0.56 for yearling hens and 0.55 for adult hens. Of all the hens that settled to breed at Windy Lake in 1988 and 1989, 57% were successful in fledging a brood. Predation was the major cause of complete nest failures. Predation of clutch caused most failures (72%), followed by depredation of the hen (24%) and brood predation (4%).";"reproduction; population attributes; rock ptarmigan; Lagopus mutus; Northwest Territories";1999;"ARCTIC";"Environmental Sciences; Geography, Physical";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

In the current study we experimentally investigated the influence of the number and sex of attending parents on growth and survival of offspring in the Kentish plover Charadrius alexandrinus, in two sites (A and B). Either the male or the female parent was removed from some broods at hatching of the chicks (female-only and male-only broods, respectively), whereas in control broods both parents were allowed to attend their young. At site A survival of the chicks was lower in uniparental (male-only and female-only) broods than in control broods, whereas we found no difference in brood survival at site B. Brood survival decreased over the season. Removal of either parent did not influence the growth of the young, although growth varied over the breeding season, and it was significantly different between the sites.

However, few comparative studies have investigated this in wild species. We tested the effects of intravenously administered chicken VIP on plasma PRL concentrations in four passerine species: the white-crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii), the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis), the Florida scrub-jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens), and the western scrub-jay (A. californica). In the white-crowned sparrow, junco, and Florida scrub-jay, which were tested during the breeding season, VIP induced a rapid increase in plasma PRL. Serial plasma sampler taken after VIP injection in the white-crowned sparrow show a 10-fold increase in PRL within 2 min of treatment, followed by a gradual decline. Effects of VIP, as compared to saline, remained significant for at least 20 min after treatment. Western scrub-jays did not respond to intravenous VIP with a significant rise in PRL secretion, possibly because they were tested after termination of the breeding season. This study indicates that VIP control of PRL release may be widespread among avian species, and that seasonal changes in plasma PRL may be mediated in part at the level of the pituitary. In addition, analysis of the control data revealed no increase in plasma PRL as a result of injection or restraint, suggesting that unlike in mammals, PRL is not released during acute stress in passerines.

In all three subspecies, transfer from short to long days triggered an increase in plasma PRL typical of an avian seasonal breeder. In z. l. gambelii, which breeds at high latitudes, temperature does not affect the rate of photoinduced gonadal maturation or luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. In this subspecies, we found that changes in plasma PRL concentrations were similar in all temperature treatments. In Z. l. pugetensis, which breeds in the Pacific Northwest, high temperatures accelerate gonadal development in females but not males and does not affect LH secretion. In this subspecies, we found that like gonadal growth, photoinduced changes in PRL secretion in z. l. pugetensis vary with ambient temperature in females but not males, In Z. l. oriantha, which breeds in alpine regions of the West, both males and females respond to temperature cues by modulating gonadal growth but not LH secretion. We found in Z. l. oriantha that ambient temperature affects PRL secretion in both sexes. These results suggest that PRL may be involved in the transduction of ambient temperature cues used to time reproductive development and the termination of seasonal breeding. Alternatively, temperature-mediated differences in plasma PRL may be a result rather than a cause of differences in gonadal development, since sex steroids affect PRL secretion in some species.

An hypothesis, poikilostasis, is introduced to describe multiple, homeostatic states whereby the regulation of metabolism and feeding occur in birds. Examples are given for both wild and domestic avian species, illustrating dynamic shifts in homeostasis responsible for the changes in body weights that are seen during the course of an annual cycle or by a particular strain of bird. The following neural structures are reviewed as each has been shown to affect food intake in birds or in mammals: ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (n.), lateral hypothalamic area, paraventricular hypothalamic n., n. tractus solitarius and area postrema, amygdala, parabrachial n., arcuate n. and bed n. of the stria terminalis. Two neural pathways are described which have been proposed to regulate feeding. The trigeminal sensorimotor pathway is the most complete neural pathway characterized for this behavior and encompasses the mechanics of pecking, grasping and mandibulating food particles from the tip of the bill to the back of the buccal cavity. A second pathway, the visceral forebrain system (VFS), affects feeding by regulating metabolism and the balance of the autonomic nervous system. Wild, migratory birds are shown to exhibit marked changes in body weight which are hypothesized to occur due to shifts in balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Domestic avian species, selected for a rapid growth rate, are shown to display a dominance of the parasympathetic nervous system. The VFS is the neural system proposed to effect poikilostasis by altering the steady state of the autonomic nervous system in aves and perhaps is applicable to other classes of vertebrates as well.

However, it is unclear how well predation rates on artificial nests reflect predation rates on natural nests. Therefore, we compared survival rates of artificial nests (unused natural nests baited with House Sparrow eggs) with survival rates of active bird nests in the same habitat at the same sites. Survival rates of artificial nests (27.7%) were significantly lower than nest survival rates of natural nests (58.6%). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the inclusion of an index of nest concealment in addition to nest type (natural or artificial) significantly increased the amount of the variability in nest predation accounted for by the regression. However, because the relationship between nest survival and nest type (natural or artificial) was still highly significant even with nest concealment included in the model, we conclude that higher rates of nest predation on artificial nests were not entirely due to the greater conspicuousness of artificial nests. We suggest that lack of parental defense is an additional contributing factor responsible for higher predation rates on artificial nests and, therefore, is likely to be a potential confounding factor in future nest predation experiments using artificial nests.";NA;1999;"JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY";"Ornithology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The concept of ontogenetic adaptations suggests that each developmental phase involves unique adaptations to the environment of the developing animal. The functional concept of optimal outbreeding has led to further experimental evidence and theoretical models concerning the role of sexual imprinting in the evolutionary process of sexual selection. From a causal perspective it has been proposed that behavioral ontogeny involves the development of various kinds of perceptual, motor, and central mechanisms and the formation of connections among them. This framework has been tested for a number of complex behavior systems such as hunger and dustbathing. Imprinting is often seen as a model system for behavioral development in general. Recent advances in imprinting research have been the result of an interdisciplinary effort involving ethology, neuroscience, and experimental psychology, with a continual interplay between these approaches.

These habitats are structurally simple and dominated by dramatic seasonality and permafrost. These adaptations are expressed in several seasonal and regional avifaunas which include the 20-25 resident bird species of the Siberian taiga, and some 15-45 typical summer visitors to hypoarctic, subalpine and tundra habitats. The survival strategies of birds in these extreme habitats are discussed in the light of experimental data and observations gathered during the seemingly most stressful periods of the birds' annual life cycle, namely mid-winter in north-eastern Asia and incubation on permafrost in upland tundra. Of the subarctic residents, only grouse utilise predictable browse foods, but have to cope with its low energy content. Winter survival in other taxa depends on utilising fall harvests and individual energy stores. In all cases, the energy utilisation in wintering birds appears to be minimised. In summer, non-resident birds treat their local resources in quite a different way with no evidence of direct energy limitation on reproduction, including incubation.

According to the most recent information, the only wild population in the world is one of about 60 individuals in Yang Xian, China. Captive populations of 54 and 17 individuals are located in Yang Xian and at Beijing Zoo, respectively and a single female of this species survives in Japan. Females of many birds stop breeding when they are brought to captivity. Hormone administration is considered to be effective in stimulating the breeding activity of such females. If the ovary of a captive female contains well-developed ova but does not ovulate, the problem is not serious. Ovulation can be induced by injection of gonadotropic hormone. However, if the ovary is regressed and contains no developed ova, the problem is serious. Until recently, no avian endocrinologist had been able to induce ovulation in hens with a regressed ovary. We developed a non-invasive method to assess the ovarian and testicular condition of birds by analysing gonadal sex steroid hormones in droppings. By using this method, we can decide whether the ovary contains developed ova or not and whether a male is sexually active or not. To reactivate a regressed ovary, we employed gonadotropin administration by means of the osmotic pump implantation in female Japanese Quail Coturnix japonica kept under short-days and then injected with the gonadotropin preparation once a day for several days. About 50% of the females laid an egg or eggs in response to the injection. Seven of the eggs were artificially incubated and two of them hatched. One of the two was revealed to be a male and fertile. The faecal sex steroid assays have been successfully applied to males of the Japanese Crested Ibis and Kakapo Strigops habroptilus in New Zealand.

Sweep netting for larvae in a semi-natural pine forest in June 1991-1996 showed that larval size, abundance and timing differed among years, and that the sites with the most larvae also differed from year to year. In the same forest, we estimated capercaillie breeding success from hens and chicks found during dog counts. The average number of young per hen in July was correlated with the size, rather than the abundance, of larvae in mid June.";"capercaillie; chick diet; faecal analysis; chick survival; geometrid larvae; sweep netting; Tetrao urogallus";1999;"WILDLIFE BIOLOGY";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA
"999";"REF0999";"WOS:000080529800003";NA;"Helle, P ; Kurki, S ; Linden, H";"Change in the sex ratio of the Finnish capercaillie Tetrao urogallus population";"Earlier reports from Fennoscandia and Russia have shown that among adult capercaillies the proportion of females is 60-65%, mainly as a consequence of high mortality of male chicks during their first months of life. The Finnish August censuses of grouse (1964-1988) show that the percentage of female capercaillie has remained unchanged at about 60-65% in northern and eastern Finland. Over the same period the percentage of females in southern and central Finland has decreased significantly from 62 to 50%. The present geographical variation in the percentage of females seems to coincide with the amount of forest in the landscape; the proportion of females is lowest in the southern and western part of Finland where the proportion of agricultural land is highest. Data from 1989-1996 show that variation in August male density among game management districts in Finland (CV%: 21.9) is significantly smaller than that of females (CV%: 33.4). This suggests that the variation in female proportion is more dependent on variation in female than in male density. The most probable reasons for the change in sex ratio include predation on females by mammalian and avian predators and selective hunting (or closing of hunting seasons), but tests of these hypotheses are premature at present.";"capercaillie; Finland; sex ratio; Tetrao urogallus";1999;"WILDLIFE BIOLOGY";"Ecology; Zoology";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA
